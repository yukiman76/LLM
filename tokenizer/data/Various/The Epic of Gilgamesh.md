## An Old Babylonian Version of the Gilgamesh Epic

_Translated by Albert T. Clay_


## Pennsylvania Tablet

### Col. I.

Gish sought to interpret the dream;
Spoke to his mother:
"My mother, during my night
I became strong and moved about
among the heroes;
And from the starry heaven
A meteor(?) of Anu fell upon me:
I bore it and it grew heavy upon me,
I became weak and its weight I could not endure.
The land of Erech gathered about it.
The heroes kissed its feet.
It was raised up before me.
They stood me up.
I bore it and carried it to thee."
The mother of Gish, who knows all things,
Spoke to Gish:
"Some one, O Gish, who like thee
In the field was born and
Whom the mountain has reared,
Thou wilt see (him) and [like a woman(?)] thou wilt rejoice.
Heroes will kiss his feet.
Thou wilt spare [him and wilt endeavor]
To lead him to me."
He slept and saw another
Dream, which he reported to his mother:
["My mother,] I have seen another
[Dream.] My likeness I have seen in the streets
[Of Erech] of the plazas.
An axe was brandished, and
They gathered about him;
And the axe made him angry.
I saw him and I rejoiced,
I loved him as a woman,
I embraced him.
I took him and regarded him
As my brother."
The mother of Gish, who knows all things,
[Spoke to Gish]:
["O Gish, the man whom thou sawest,]
[Whom thou didst embrace like a woman].


### Col II.

(means) that he is to be associated with thee."
Gish understood the dream.
[As] Enki[du] was sitting before the woman,
[Her] loins(?) he embraced, her vagina(?) he opened.
[Enkidu] forgot the place where he was born.
Six days and seven nights
Enkidu continued
To cohabit with [the courtesan].
[The woman] opened her [mouth] and
Spoke to Enkidu:
"I gaze upon thee, O Enkidu, like a god art thou!
Why with the cattle
Dost thou [roam] across the field?
Come, let me lead thee
into [Erech] of the plazas,
to the holy house, the dwelling of Anu,
O, Enkidu arise, let me conduct thee
To Eanna, the dwelling of Anu,
The place [where Gish is, perfect] in vitality.
And thou [like a wife wilt embrace] him.
Thou [wilt love him like] thyself.
Come, arise from the ground
(that is) cursed."
He heard her word and accepted her speech.
The counsel of the woman
Entered his heart.
She stripped off a garment,
Clothed him with one.
Another garment
She kept on herself.
She took hold of his hand.
Like [a god(?)] she brought him
To the fertile meadow,
The place of the sheepfolds.
In that place they received food;
[For he, Enkidu, whose birthplace was the mountain,]
[With the gazelles he was accustomed to eat herbs,]
[With the cattle to drink water,]
[With the water beings he was happy.]

_(Perhaps one additional line missing.)_


### Col. III.

Milk of the cattle
He was accustomed to suck.
Food they placed before him,
He broke (it) off and looked
And gazed.
Enkidu had not known
To eat food.
To drink wine
He had not been taught.
The woman opened her mouth and
Spoke to Enkidu:
"Eat food, O Enkidu,
The provender of life!
Drink wine, the custom of the land!"
Enkidu ate food
Till he was satiated.
Wine he drank,
Seven goblets.
His spirit was loosened, he became hilarious.
His heart became glad and
His face shone.
[The barber(?)] removed
The hair on his body.
He was anointed with oil.
He became manlike.
He put on a garment,
He was like a man.
He took his weapon;
Lions he attacked,
(so that) the night shepherds could rest.
He plunged the dagger;
Lions he overcame.
The great [shepherds] lay down;
Enkidu was their protector.
The strong man,
The unique hero,
To [the shepherds(?)] he speaks:

_(About five lines missing.)_


### Col. IV.

_(About eight lines missing.)_

Making merry.
He lifted up his eyes,
He sees the man.
He spoke to the woman:
"O, courtesan, lure on the man.
Why has he come to me?
His name I will destroy."
The woman called to the man
Who approaches to him and he beholds him.
"Away! why dost thou [quake(?)]
Evil is the course of thy activity."
Then he opened his mouth and
Spoke to Enkidu:
"[To have (?)] a family home
Is the destiny of men, and
The prerogative(?) of the nobles.
For the city(?) load the workbaskets!
Food supply for the city lay to one side!
For the King of Erech of the plazas,
Open the hymen(?), perform the marriage act!
For Gish, the King of Erech of the plazas,
Open the hymen(?),
Perform the marriage act!
With the legitimate wife one should cohabit.
So before,
As well as in the future.
By the decree pronounced by a god,
From the cutting of his umbilical cord
(Such) is his fate."
At the speech of the hero
His face grew pale.

### Col. V.

_(About six lines missing.)_

[Enkidu] went [in front],
And the courtesan behind him.
He entered into Erech of the plazas.
The people gathered about him.
As he stood in the streets
Of Erech of the plazas,
The men gathered,
Saying in regard to him:
"Like the form of Gish he has suddenly become;
shorter in stature.
[In his structure high(?)], powerful,
.......... overseeing(?)
In the land strong of power has he become.
Milk of cattle
He was accustomed to suck."
Steadily(?) in Erech .....
The heroes rejoiced.
He became a leader.
To the hero of fine appearance,
To Gish, like a god,
He became a rival to him.
For Ishḫara a couch
Was stretched, and
Gish [lay down, and afterwards(?)]
In the night he fled.
He approaches and
[Enkidu stood] in the streets.
He blocked the path
of Gish.
At the exhibit of his power,

_(About three lines missing.)_


### Col. VI.

_(About four lines missing.)_

Strong(?) ...
Gish
Against him [Enkidu proceeded],
[His hair] luxuriant.
He started [to go]
Towards him.
They met in the plaza of the district.
Enkidu blocked the gate
With his foot,
Not permitting Gish to enter.
They seized (each other), like oxen,
They fought.
The threshold they demolished;
The wall they impaired.
Gish and Enkidu
Seized (each other).
Like oxen they fought.
The threshold they demolished;
The wall they impaired.
Gish bent
His foot to the ground,
His wrath was appeased,
His breast was quieted.
When his breast was quieted,
Enkidu to him
Spoke, to Gish:
"As a unique one, thy mother
bore thee.
The wild cow of the stall,
Ninsun,
Has exalted thy head above men.
Kingship over men
Enlil has decreed for thee.

Enkidu opened his mouth and
spoke to Gišh:
"Know, my friend, in the mountain,
when I moved about with the cattle
to a distance of one double hour into the heart of the forest,
[Alone?] I penetrated within it,
[To] Ḫuwawa, whose roar is a flood,
whose mouth is fire,
whose breath is death.
Why dost thou desire
To do this?
To advance towards
the dwelling(?) of Ḫuwawa?"

### Col. IV.

To keep safe [the cedar forest],
[Enlil has decreed for it] seven-fold terror."
Gish [opened] his mouth and
spoke to [Enkidu]:
"Whoever, my friend, overcomes (?) [terror(?)],
it is well (for him) with Shamash for the length of [his days].
Mankind will speak of it at the gates.
Wherever terror is to be faced,
Thou, forsooth, art in fear of death.
Thy prowess lacks strength.
I will go before thee.
Though thy mouth calls to me; "thou art afraid to approach."
If I fall, I will establish my name.

[The work(?)] to the artisans they entrusted.
A dwelling(?) they assigned to the workmen.
Hatchets the masters moulded:
Axes of  talents each they moulded.
Lances the masters moulded;
Blades(?) of  talents each,
A spear of  mina each attached to them.

### Col. V.

Gish of whom they speak, let me see!
whose name fills the lands.
I will lure him to the cedar forest,
Like a strong offspring of Erech.
I will let the land hear (that)
I am determined to lure (him) in the cedar (forest).
A name I will establish."
The elders of Erech of the plazas
brought word to Gish:
"Thou art young, O Gish, and thy heart carries thee away.
Thou dost not know what thou proposest to do.
We hear that Huwawa is enraged.
Who has ever opposed his weapon?
To one [double hour] in the heart of the forest,
Who has ever penetrated into it?
Ḫuwawa, whose roar is a deluge,
whose mouth is fire, whose breath is death.
Why dost thou desire to do this?
To advance towards the dwelling (?) of Ḫuwawa?"
Gish heard the report of his counsellors.
He saw and cried out to [his] friend:
"Now, my friend, thus [I speak].
I fear him, but [I will go to the cedar forest(?)];
I will go [with thee to the cedar forest].

Thy god may (?) ........ thee;
On the road may he guide [thee in safety(?)].
At the rampart of [Erech of the plazas],
Gish kneeled down [before Shamash(?)],
A word then he spoke [to him]:
"I will go, O Shamash, [thy] hands [I seize hold of].
When I shall have saved [my life],
Bring me back to the rampart [in Erech].
Grant protection [to me ?]!"
Gish cried, "[my friend] ......

[Again] they approached Gish!

"[How long] till thou returnest to Erech?"
[Again the elders] approached him.
[For] the road they counselled Gis:

"Do [not] rely, O Gish, on thy strength!
Provide food and save thyself!
Let Enkidu go before thee.
He is acquainted with the way, he has trodden the road

May he level the road for thy treading!
May he level the mountain for thy foot!
During thy night the word that wilt rejoice

In the river of Ḫuwawa as thou plannest,

Round about thee dig a well!
May there be pure water constantly for thy libation
Goblets of water pour out to Shamash!
[May] Lugal-banda take note of it!"
[Enkidu] opened his mouth and spoke to Gish:

"[Since thou art resolved] to take the road.
Thy heart [be not afraid,] trust to me!
[Confide] to my hand his dwelling(?)!"
[on the road to] Ḫuwawa they proceeded.
