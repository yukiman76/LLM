**LLM Base Repository**
=====================

Welcome to the LLM  repository, where we develop, train and fine tune large language models to push the boundaries of natural language processing and understanding.

**About**
--------

Searching the web for resources on how to develop your own LLM's from scratch and then fine tune in an iterative process is overly complex I wanted to single place where I and others can learn and share is valuable knowledge, This repository contains the implementation and training code for a large language model, including model architectures, training scripts, and evaluation metrics. This repo is designed to assist in the learning of how Large Language models are trained on large amounts of text data and generate human-like language outputs. This is an ongoing effort as the AI world changes so must this resource 



**Getting Started**
--------------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10
* PyTorch 1.9+ (see local readme for some restrictions)
* NVIDIA GPU (recommended)
* conda

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com//llm.git`
2. Change director to a project cd base/gpt2
2. Follow Local Readme for a given project example


**Directory Structure**
---------------------

* `base/`: Base LLM modes from scratch
* `data/`: Datasets and data preprocessing scripts, limited bring your own data
* `notebooks/`: Training, evaluation, and inference scripts
