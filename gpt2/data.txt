He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On back roads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:

"When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me
Mmmm

He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"




State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine I'll tell mine that you're gay!
By the way...

I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn!

There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn!

And if you're missing me
You'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here
Would be bad for your health...

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that...

Stupid old pickup truck
You never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak
Who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match
On all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned
You're just another picture to burn!

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn...




Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

So, I drive home alone
As I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down
And maybe get some sleep tonight

'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing. Don't know why I do

He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see




I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
Oh I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

Oh I'm just a girl
Oh I'm just a girl, oh, oh
Oh I'm just a girl




You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So I start a fight 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want 'cause I'm not what you wanted

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray
And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
So just walk away, ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You never did give a damn thing, honey, but I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody if I died, died for you, died for you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending given to a perfect day
Every smile you fake is so condescending counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you




I didn't know what I would find
When I went looking for a reason
I know I didn't read between the lines
And, baby, I've got nowhere to go

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you
And now it's all too late. So you see

You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

Oh, yeah

So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
And I can still see you
This ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
And I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside




Seems the only one who doesn't see your beauty
Is the face in the mirror looking back at you
You walk around here thinking you're not pretty
But that's not true 'cause I know you

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

I guess it's true that love was all you wanted
'Cause you're giving it away like it's extra change
Hoping it will end up in his pocket
But he leaves you out like a penny in the rain

Oh, 'cause it's not his price to pay
It's not his price to pay

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

Hold on, baby, you're losing it
The water's high, you're jumping into it
And letting go
And no one knows
That you cry, but you don't tell anyone
That you might not be the golden one
And you're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone

You're tied together with a smile
But you're coming undone
Goodbye, baby
With a smile, baby, baby




Cory's eyes are like a jungle
He smiles, it's like the radio
He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows
There's pretty girls on every corner
That watch him as he's walking home
Saying, "Does he know?"
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save them for a rainy day
It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away
I should say, hey, by the way

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

If you and I are a story
That never gets told
If what you are is a daydream
I'll never get to hold
At least you'll know

You're beautiful
Every little piece love
And don't you know
You're really gonna be someone
Ask anyone
And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my front door
Oh, but if it don't
Will you stay
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful?
La la la
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful
Stay beautiful
Na, na, na, na, na




It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you feels wrong

You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

You can see that I've been crying
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, "Yes."

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me

I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this:
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No... no, no, no...

You should've said "No", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd,
Get back to me (get back to me).
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, "Why?"
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet...
You should've said "No", baby, and you might still have me




She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky, the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said, "Oh my, my, my"

Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me
You never did, you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, "Oh my, my, my"

Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh my, my, my, my

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me, got down on one knee

Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said "I do" and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my, my, my




I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel
On the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothing
I was just thinking
How we don't have a song"
And he says...

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have."
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again

I was walking up
The front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong
And been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway,
Well, on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice
All the roses
And the note that said...

Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again

I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song...

'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home ... 'fore I said, "Amen"
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again

Oh, yeah...
Oh-oh, yeah

I was riding shotgun
With my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen
And an old napkin
And I wrote down our song




Friday night beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky
And sometimes we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

And I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

Just a small town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
And I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all nobody gets me like you do

And you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me when I'm with you

When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

...That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half I'm only tryna let you know that what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Well, I'm only me when I'm with you
With you




She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile
She'll never notice how you stop and stare
Whenever she walks by

And you can't see me wantin' you the way you want her
But you are everything to me

And I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

There's a fire inside of you
That can't help but shine through
She's never gonna see the light
No matter what you do

And all I think about is how to make you think of me
And everything that we could be

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
She's never gonna love you like I want to
And you just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

Like shadows in a faded light
Oh, we're invisible
I just wanna open your eyes
And make you realize

I just wanna show you
She don't even know you
Baby, let me love you
Let me want you
You just see right through me
But if you only knew me
We could be a beautiful
Miracle
Unbelievable
Instead of just invisible

She can't see the way your eyes
Light up when you smile




Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

Maybe I should've seen the signs, should've read the writing on the wall
And realized by the distance in your eyes that I would be the one to fall
No matter what you say, I still can't believe
That you would walk away
It don't make sense to me, but

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

It's not unbroken anymore
How do I get it back the way it was before?

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break, would you wanna break a

Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?
Why would you wanna take our love and tear it all apart, now?
Why would you wanna make the very first scar?
Why would you wanna break a perfectly good heart?

2007



Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't wanna think about that right now
'Cause everything I want is miles away
In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine

I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold
And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold

But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?
When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?

I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine

You were mine




What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?
Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?
Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial?
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

There's gotta be more
There's gotta be more

2008



Your beautiful eyes
Stare right into my eyes
And sometimes I think of you late at night
I don't know why, I

I wanna be somewhere where you are
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

I wake up, I'm alive
In only a little while I'll cry
'Cause you're my lullaby
So baby, come hold me tight 'cause I-I

I wanna be everything you need
I wanna be where

You're here, your eyes are looking into mine
So baby, make me fly
My heart has never felt this way before
I'm looking through your
I'm looking through your eyes

Just as long as you're mine
I'll be your everything tonight
Let me love you, kiss you
Oh, baby, let me miss you
Let me see your
Dream about, dream about
Dream about your eyes
Eyes, eyes
Beautiful eyes




Wish I had concentrated
They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I created
I keep my life in black and blue
Before you ask me if I'm alright
Think about what I had to do, ooh yeah

Wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

I'll be fine if you just walk by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right
But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night

And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through

I had to wake up and smell the breakup
Fix my heart, put on my make-up
Another mess I didn't plan
And I'll bet you thought you beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an I heart question mark
Written on the back of my hand

And when you're home all alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh baby
I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

Wake up and smell the breakup
Realize that we won't make-up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an I heart question mark written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An I heart question mark, yeah
Written on the back of my hand




There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one-horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Oh, oh

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Oh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah




You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors




We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, "Hello"
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"

Oh, oh

And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

And I said, "Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you




Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you
And as we walked we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Hey Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine
Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha-ha)

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Ah-uh, myself
Mmm-mm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself
Oh-oh-oh
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm




Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

Maybe I was naïve, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now




You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me



(feat. Colbie Caillat)

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh, ooh)
I'm sorry




I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfect day
Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm tryin' to say, oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doin' to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Oh)

I take a step back, I let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know




All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh
You're not sorry
No, no, oh-oh

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh
Oh, oh, oh, no, no, no, no, no, no




He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, "You look beautiful tonight."
And I feel perfectly fine

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He respects my space
And never makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2 AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh

Whoa, whoa, oh-oh, oh
And that's the way I loved you oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, whoa
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you




Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."

Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore

And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always."
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always."
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always."
You didn't mean it baby
You said, "Forever and always," yeah




I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today

I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today




Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain't fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

Tonight, we'll stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah




I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard
I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice
I hear the words but all I can think is
We should be together

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

Well I like the way your hair falls in your face
You got the keys to me
I love each freckle on your face, oh
I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it o-over
And all I can say is come closer
Take a deep breath and jump then fall into me

'Cause every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

Whoa oh, I'm feeling you, baby
Don't be afraid to
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall

The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you
The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

Whoa oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please
Jump then fall
Jump then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So jump then fall
Jump then fall, baby
Jump then fall into me, into me

Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump then fall, jump then fall
Jump then fall into me, into me, yeah




Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can't tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

I'm caught up in you
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
But you're untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, come on
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, oh, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh

It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh




I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore
And I know all the steps up to your door
But I don't wanna go there anymore

Talk to the wind, talk to the sky
Talk to the man with the reasons why
And let me know what you find

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far
And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I've watched you so long, screamed your name
I don't know what else I can say

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night for all these games
Just know I'm right here hoping
That you'll come in with the rain

I could go back to every laugh
But I don't wanna go there anymore




This is wrong but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothing more right babe
Misty morning comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
And I knew from the first note played
I'd be breaking all my rules to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't keep my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Morning loneliness
Comes around when I'm not dreaming about you
When my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town
And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you
You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

You played in bars, you play guitar
And I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
I can't take my eyes off of you
I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl
Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall, superstar

Sweet, sweet superstar
Superstar




In the heat of the fight I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin'
Tryna make me stay
I said, "This time I've had enough"
And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up

'Cause I'm so mad I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

Me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door
And all the things that I misread

Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

I said, "Leave," but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

And I'll scream out the window
I can't even look at you
I don't need you but I do, I do, I do
I say, "There's nothing you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it"
But what I mean is

I said, "Leave," but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles
Screamin', "I'm in love with you"
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door

With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you




Today was a fairytale
You were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
I wore a dress
You wore a dark grey t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around

Can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale
You've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale
All that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale



(feat. Maren Morris)

Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain, but I never do
The way the tires turn stones, on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath
Reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it right off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
Well, I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then

And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows, too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see, that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me




Mr. "Perfect face"
Mr. "Here to stay"
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
Everything was right
Mr. "I've been waiting for you all my life"
Mr. "Every single day until the end, I will be by your side"

But that was when I got to know Mr. "Change of heart"
Mr. "Leaves me all alone," I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breaking mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

Mr. "Never told me why"
Mr. "Never had to see me cry"
Mr. "Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy"
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same

'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never fazed you

Hello Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Hello Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" since your goodbye
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"

So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay away to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. "Always wins"
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss "Here to stay"
Now I'm Miss "Gonna be alright someday"
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. "Too late"

Goodbye Mr. "Perfectly fine"
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. "Always at the right place at the right time," baby
Goodbye Mr. "Casually cruel"
Mr. "Everything revolves around you"
I've been Miss "Misery" for the last time
And you're Mr. "Perfectly fine"
You're perfectly fine
Mr. "Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away"
You said you'd never go away




We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night and we were happy
I do recall a good while back, we snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck, back when I deserved it
And we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

We used to watch the sun go down on the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder 'cause we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm we were gonna buy someday
And we were happy
We were happy

Oh, I hate those voices telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices and that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy, we were happy

When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we laughed in the dark
Talking 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy
Yeah, we were happy
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
We were happy



(feat. Keith Urban)

You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
You watched me go
And I knew my
Words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And you said that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when
Mm, mm

I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong
Made mistakes
And put you through all of this" (through all of this)
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"

And I said, that's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"

And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
And I said

"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when, it was sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that's when, you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"

That's when, when I wake up in the morning (Yeah)
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
(That when I miss you, that's when I want you)
That's when, when I see your face
That's when I love you, that's when




Hey, I knew I'd run into you somewhere
It's been a while, I didn't mean to stare
I heard she's nothin' like me
I'm sure she'll make you happy

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah

Sometimes I really wish that I could hate you
I've tried, but that's just somethin' I can't do
My heart knows what the truth is
I swore I wouldn't do this

But don't you
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

So I walk outta here tonight
Try to go on with my life
And you can say, "We're still friends"
I don't wanna pretend
So if I see you again

Don't you (Don't you)
Don't you smile at me and ask me how I've been
Don't you (Don't you), say you've missed me if you don't want me again
You don't (You don't), know how much I feel I love you still
So why don't you, don't you?

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Don't you, ah, ah, ah




It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin
I'm driving away and I, I guess you could say
This is the last time I'll drive this way again
Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray
'Cause I, I still love you but I can't

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

The picture frame is empty
On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Bye, bye, baby

And there's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

Bye, bye, to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you back but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me
Oh, you took me home, I thought you were gonna keep me
Bye, bye, baby
Bye, bye, baby

2009



I'd never gone with the wind
Just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door
There's so much more
I'd never seen it before

I was trying to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

I've watched from a distance
As you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know
How that would feel
And you made it so real

You showed me something that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes and you made me believe

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm falling and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

Baby, you showed me what living is for
I don't wanna hide anymore

You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
Crazier, crazier.




Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

You were in college working part-time, waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Oh-oh, oh

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out cryin' and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"

You said, "I remember how it felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"

Hold on and make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on, yeah)
Yes, yes, and I can see it (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it now (See it now, see it now)




The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly




I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall

And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

All the time




I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"

Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be

She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"

Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

I hear the preacher say

There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you

I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, "Speak now"
And you say, "Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"




Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you
Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back to turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day
Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I shoulda known

You are an expert at "Sorry" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh

Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known

You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known




You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again

I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion but nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?




I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on

Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Next chapter

How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin' to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're goin' down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The end




Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Never grow up

You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots

But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone

So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on

Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

Oh, oh (Never grow up)
Don't you ever grow up
Oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up




There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say

All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Oh-oh)

This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you




Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh

She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"




I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, and life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back




You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it




I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, mm-hmm

So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last




I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives would
Never be the same
You held your head like a hero on a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

I said, "Remember this feeling"
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves in ripped up jeans
Got to rule the world

Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you

Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered




Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say

Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours




Tall, dark, and superman
He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, "How are you?"
And I'll say, "Just fine"
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever
And I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
When you come back down



(feat. Fall Out Boy)

Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights

All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm




When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor
Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain
When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own
'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave

And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A
She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning

Emma met a boy with eyes like a man
Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand
Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town
And all the bad boys would be good boys
If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her




Uh-uh, uh, uh

You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I've been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it

But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

Uh-uh, uh, uh

And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet

But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

Uh-uh, uh, uh

I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note saying, "Meet me tonight"
Then we kissed and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself

Uh-uh, uh, uh
Oh-oh, oh, oh

I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you, oh, I can see you

Oh, I see you, I see you, baby
I see you
(Uh-uh, uh, uh) I see you, I see you, baby
Oh, baby

(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

Once, I had an empire in a golden age
I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept

And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now

My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screamin' at the palace's front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me

My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now, now

(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)




My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand
Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high
Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right
And I will block out these voices of reason in my head

And the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson"

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

You know how to keep me waitin'
I know how to act like I'm fine
Don't know what to call this situation
But I know I can't call you mine
And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof
'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about
Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news

But then the voices say, "You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson"

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out

Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', "How could I not see the signs?"
Oh, you haven't written me or called
But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring
And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson

Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh

La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la
Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
No, he just wasn't the one




Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, "Photos: twenty-five cents each"
Black and white, saw a '30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if we'd met

On a crowded street in 1944
And you were headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop
I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs
Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face

In the fifteen hundreds off in a foreign land
And I was forced to marry another man
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless

Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, "Hello"

In a crowded room a few short years ago
And sometimes there's no proof, you just know
You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, "Oh my, we really were timeless"

We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And somethin' in my head said, "Stop," so I walked in




Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there
I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

I know people change and these things happen
But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door

And I say, "Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now"

Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now

You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought that you'd be here by now
Oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now

(feat. Joy Williams & John Paul White)

I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window, darlin', everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps ragin' on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone, gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh (Oh)
Oh (Oh)
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Oh
Oh

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come, morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

2012



Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around), oh they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown) and nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just gotta keep your eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open


“Red (Taylor’s Version)” (released November 12, 2021) (original version released October 22, 2012)



I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds or fades in time

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room, and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age of something good and right and real

And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same, oh
And I never saw you coming
And I'll never be the same
(So you were never a saint, and I loved in shades of wrong)
(We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts)
(But this love is brave and wild)

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right




Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright, just before they lose it all

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
But loving him was red
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)
(Red, red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red

(Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Burning red (Red, red, red; red, red, red)
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)

And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red, red; red, red, red)
Comes back to me (Red, red, red; red, red, red), burning red
(Red, red, red; red, red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red, red; red, red, red)

His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street




Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I would
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I, I, I
I, I, I
I, I, I

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night and I will
Get you a, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind and I just
Think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive and I will
Follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it




Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble




I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay but I'm not fine at all, oh-oh-oh

'Cause there we are again on that
Little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were
Looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee ball team
You taught me about your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough to forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
Till you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well




It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Ah, ah, ah, ah
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Ah ah, ah, ah
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids ("Who is Taylor Swift anyway?")
Ah ah, ah ah
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping, yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks, it's time
Ah, ah

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
22
22 (I don't know about you)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22
22
22 (Dancing like)
22
22

It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you




I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I bet
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do
I almost do

I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way
And I confess, baby
In my dreams you're touching my face
And asking me if I'd want to try again with you
And I almost do

And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me
Not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't
I almost do, I almost do

I bet this time of night you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city and I hope
Sometimes you wonder 'bout me




I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, "This is it, I've had enough", 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say

Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, "I hate you," we break up, you call me, "I love you"

Ooh, we called it off again last night but
Ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, you called me up again tonight but
Ooh, this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

Yeah
Yeah
Yeah

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never

So he calls me up and he's like, "I still love you"
And I'm like, I'm just, I mean this is exhausting you know?
Like we are never getting back together
Like, ever

(No)
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

(We)
No
(Getting back together)
(We)
(Getting back together)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together




I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away but you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet and said, "Ok, let's talk"
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay

You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams
I just like hanging out with you
All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life

Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

That's so fun



(feat. Gary Lightbody)

I find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I'm not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better

And right before your eyes
I'm aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye

This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(You break my heart)
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this




I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone
And Lord it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

And darling it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We block the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd

'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you




Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
And we both wake in lonely beds, different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
And you've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair (Whoa, oh, whoa, oh)

Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back
A beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful

What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair




New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh

Now, it's big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused
'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place

Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you'll make it out alive

And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now

'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right

Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, whoa, oh, oh



(feat. Ed Sheeran)

(You good to go?)

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

All I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed




I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night
Never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picks me up late one night
Out the window, we were seventeen and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

And I said, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

He said, "Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way"
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
"Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Like, "Oh my, what a marvelous tune"
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)
(Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Oh my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Like starlight, starlight (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Like we dream impossible dreams (Ooh, hoo, hoo)

Don't you see the starlight, starlight? (Ooh, hoo, hoo)
Don't you dream impossible things?




Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do

I walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do

But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again




You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that "Baby, I'm right here" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy

Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly


And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing

But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

You called me later
And said, "I'm sorry I didn't make it"
And I said, "I'm sorry, too"
And that was the moment I knew




You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

This is falling in love in the cruellest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

Oh-oh, oh-oh
I don't wanna miss you like this
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Come back, be here
Come back, be here




Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that

I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

I just wanna make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her




I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear

"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray, we'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"

What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back




I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

I wish it wasn't 4AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, "You know you had to do it"
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning

But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
Talking down to me like I'd always be around
Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

I hold onto this pride because these days it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah

Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye, like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, yeah
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man



(feat. Phoebe Bridgers)

They tell you while you're young

Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

How long will it be cute, all this crying in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention
And someone else lights up the room?
People love an ingénue

I've had too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growing up to breaking down?
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me when I'm nothing new?

I know someday I'm gonna meet her
It's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh woah, oh woah, oh, oh

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me, will you still want me
Will you still want me when I'm nothing new?




What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? (No)

What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
(What about your promises, promises, promises?)

What a waste
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe? (What about your promises, promises?)

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you

Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you, babe
What a shame didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe (This is the last time, this is the last time)
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said, "No one else"
We ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
You said, "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe

What about your promises, promises?




I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightening
Standing here waiting, waiting
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes
Tongue tied
But, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless
Look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replaying your laughter
Disaster

'Cause, now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feeling like a face in the crowd
I'm reaching for you, terrified

'Cause you could be the one that I love
And I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

How is it in London? (London)
Where were you while I'm wondering (Wondering)
If I'll ever see you again?

You could be the one that I love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping it gets to you

'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep
And I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standing here hoping it gets to you

You could be the one that I love
You could be the one that I love
My love
And, now, I'm standing here hoping this gets to you



(feat. Chris Stapleton)

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh

Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me

You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills

But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes

Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'

Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?

Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
That it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say

I bet you think about me




He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, "Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?"
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3 A.M., pacing
He says, "It's not just a phase I'm in"
My voice comes out begging

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

He seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5 A.M., wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

All this time I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go

I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go

I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 A.M., pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 A.M., wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go

He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, "Believe in one thing, I won't go away"



(feat. Ed Sheeran)

One, two, three, four

Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town
And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote

There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame
Take it with you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go where our eyes can take us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

So you laugh like a child
And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be, no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket
Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

And run, like you'd run from the law
Darling, let's run
Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run

There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark
Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run (And we run, and we run, and we run)

Like you'd run from the law (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Darling, let's run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Run from it all (And we run, and we run, and we run)
We can go where our eyes can take us (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Go where no one else is, run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, we'll run (And we run, and we run, and we run)
Ooh, and we'll run




I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it goes
Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone and I don't seem brokenhearted
My friends all say they know everything I'm going through
I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't riding in the car when we both fell
Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture
They don't know how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

And so it was
We never saw it coming
Not trying to fall in love
But we did like children running
Back then we didn't know we were built to fall apart
We broke the status quo, then we broke each other's hearts
But don't forget about the night out in LA
Danced in the kitchen, chased me down through the hallway
No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you

I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you

I remember the night at the hotel
I was riding in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper

I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you




I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, "fuck the patriarchy"
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
And I was thinking on the drive down, any time now
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weeping in a party bathroom
Some actress asking me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willing you to come
And he said, "It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one"

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes

From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you, too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us), all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "No"
You never saw it comin'
Slipped when you started runnin'
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin'
You hit the ground runnin'
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along."
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)

I'll be one of the many saying,

I'll be one of the many saying,

I'll be one of the many saying,

I'll be one of the many saying,


And when they call your name
and they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "No"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall (ten feet tall)
I will say, "I knew it all along." (I knew it all along)
Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand next to me (next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (ooooh)
Your eyes are wider than distance (your eyes)
This life is sweeter than fiction (than fiction)

It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter than, sweeter
Sweeter than fiction

“1989 (Taylor’s Version)” (released October 27, 2023) (original version released October 27, 2014)



Walking through a crowd
The village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud
Heartbeats under coats
Everybody here
Wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't
Heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on
Apartment floors
Took our broken hearts
Put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else
Before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and
Girls and girls

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York)
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

Like any great love it keeps you
Guessing
Like any real love
It's ever-changing
Like any true love

It drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't
Change anything anything
Anything

Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack
I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
New soundtrack
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright
But they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright
They never blind me
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York




Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"
Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like

I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say, I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name




Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh, it's been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, hmm, yeah
I say, "I heard, oh, that you've been out and about with some other girl, some other girl."

He says, "What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you," and I
I said, "I've been there, too, a few times."

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt)
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go)
We never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home, yeah
Just take me home
(Out of style)

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down (when we go)
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style




Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Oh
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods?

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in a hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, "I'm settin' you free,"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me

You were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
I remember
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Oh, I remember

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
(Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
(Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good




(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

People like you always want back the love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you when you say you've changed
The more I think about it now the less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up, but I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces of the mess you made
People like you always want back the love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever when you say goodbye

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Let me remind you
This was what you wanted
You ended it
You were all I wanted
But not like this
Not like this
Not like this

Oh, all you had to do was...

Stay
Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
All you had to do was stay

Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Then why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay
Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late
Well, could've been easy
(All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay




I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say, mmm-mmm
That's what people say, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't see, mmm-mmm

I'm dancing on my own (dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mmm-mmm
That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying, "It's gonna be alright."

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Shake it off, I shake it off,

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat.

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my God!" but I'm just gonna shake.
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake

Yeah ohhh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (haters gonna hate)
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart-breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (mmmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (and fake, and fake, and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (you've got to),
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off,
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off




It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say it's in the past, you drive straight ahead
You're thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
And I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
And I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

(I wish I, wish I)

2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that I'd never forget you as long as I live
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for
I wish you knew that I miss you too much to be mad anymore
I wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

You always knew how to push my buttons
You give me everything and nothing
This mad mad love makes you come running
To stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)

I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish
I, I, I, I, I, I wish, I wish you would




'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you have to do this? I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep, salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Did you think we'd be fine? Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past, these kinda wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through? All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't, so if you're coming my way, just don't

Oh, it's so sad to think about the good times, you and I

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (ghosts)
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (hey)
You say sorry just for show (hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (hey)
Mhmmm
If you love like that blood runs cold

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
(Hey)

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood
Hey




He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around
(Follow you around)

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha




Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Stand there like a ghost
Shaking from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, "Are you insane?"
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then, you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah-yeah
With pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind, ooh-ooh
When you left her all alone
And never told her why, why

And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now, you say

I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
Yeah, yeah

And you know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
That I don't want you to go, oh, oh

Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah-yeah
And then you say

'Cause I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (This is how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl)
(That's how it works)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)

That's how it works
That's how you got the girl




Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
And I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)

Your kiss, my cheek
I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost
I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh
(This love) This love left a permanent mark
(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh
(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)
This love, this love came back to me, oh-oh, oh




(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They are the hunters, we are the foxes
And we run
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it
My love

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, but we're bulletproof
I know places
And you know for me, it's always you
I know places
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
I know places
And I know for you, it's always me
I know places

(I, I, I, I I, I, I, I I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I)




The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing

Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
(Oh)

The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

(Oh, oh)
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh
(Oh, oh, oh)
Think I'm finally clean




Flashing lights and we
Took a wrong turn and we
Fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed

But there were strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams

Oh

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Oh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind

But darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever
Eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better
Eh eh

Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland
Eh eh eh eh eh
In wonderland

I reached for you but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else to make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

Oh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever)
Eh eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (never better)
Eh eh

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland)

We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland




One look, dark room
Meant just for you
Time moved too fast
You play it back
Buttons on a coat
Lighthearted joke
No proof, not much
But you saw enough
Small talk, he drives
Coffee at midnight
The light reflects
The chain on your neck
He says, "Look up."
And your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch
But you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

Morning, his place
Burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt
He keeps his word
And for once you let go
Of your fears and your ghosts
One step, not much
But it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks
You fight then you talk
One night he wakes
Strange look on his face
Pauses, then says

And you knew what it was
He is in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You're in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence (silence), silence (silence) you
You can feel it on the way home (way home), way home (way home) you
You can see it with the lights out (lights out), lights out (lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love




We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

So come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free

Please take my hand and
Please take me dancing and
Please leave me stranded
It's so romantic (it's so romantic)
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

Oh, 'cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

'Cause baby, I could build a castle (castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


“”Slut!” (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”

Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
What if all I need is you?

Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't

But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman

Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)
Love to think you'll never forget
We'll pay the price, I guess

But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up)
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)
You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love

Half asleep, takin' your time
In the tangerine, neon light, this is luxury
You're not sayin' you're in love with me
But you're going to
Half awake, takin' your chances
It's a big mistake, I said, "It might blow up in your pretty face"
I'm not saying, "Do it anyway" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to

(Up)
And if they call me a (Slut)
You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)
I might as well be drunk in love 


“Say Don’t Go (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”

I've known it from the very start
We're a shot in the darkest dark
Oh no, oh no
I'm unarmed
The waiting is a sadness
Fading into madness
Oh no, oh no
It won't stop

I'm standing on a tightrope, alone
I hold my breath a little bit longer
Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holding out hope for you to say, "Don't go"
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"

Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

Now I'm pacing on shaky ground
Strike a match, then you blow it out
Oh no, oh no
It's not fair
'Cause you kiss me and it stops time
And I'm yours, but you're not mine
Oh no, oh no
You're not there

I'm standing on the sidewalk, alone
I wait for you to drive by
I was trying to see the cards that you won't show
I'm about to fold unless you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Oh-ah

Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

Why'd you have to make me want you? (Why'd you have to make me want you?)
Why'd you have to give me nothing back? (Why'd you have to)
Why'd you have to make me love you? (Why'd you have to make me love you?)
I said, "I love you," you say nothing back (I said, "I love you")

Why'd you have to lead me on?
Why'd you have to twist the knife?
Walk away and leave me bleeding, bleeding
Why'd you whisper in the dark
Just to leave me in the night?
Now your silence has me screaming, screaming
Say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go" (Say, "Don't go")
Say, say, say, say

But you won't
But you won't
But you won't
I would stay forever if you say, "Don't go"
But you won't
But you won't
But you won't 


“Now That We Don’t Talk (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”

You went to a party, I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea, don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though, on the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk

You grew your hair long, you got new icons
And from the outside, it looks like you're trying lives on
I miss the old ways, you didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

I called my mom, she said that it was for the best
Remind myself the more I gave, you'd want me less
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with?
Truth is, I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended, so

I called my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)
Remind myself the way you faded till I left (Till I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (What I lost)
And what it cost
Now that we don't talk

I don't have to pretend I like acid rock
Or that I'd like to be on a mega-yacht
With important men who think important thoughts
Guess maybe I am better off
Now that we don't talk

And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery
Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be
Now that we don't talk 


“Suburban Legends (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”

You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision
I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer
All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious
Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turning out my empty pockets
And when it came to you

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs
Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion
Walking in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries
With the pages ripped out
I am standing in a 1950s gymnasium
And I can still see you now

I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I know that you still remember
We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together
And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore, and my whole life's ruined

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it
Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore, and I always knew it
And my life had been ruined 


“Is It Over Now? (Taylor’s Version) (From the Vault)”

Once the flight had flown
With the wilt of the rose
I slept all alone
You still wouldn't go

Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every maiden's bed for something greater

Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
 I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then?
And is it over now?

When you lost control
Red blood, white snow
Blue dress on a boat
Your new girl is my clone

And did you think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs
Oh Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running
And say the one thing I've been wanting
But no!

Let's fast forward to 300 awkward blind dates later
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her
You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor
You search in every model's bed for something greater

Baby, was it over when she laid down on your couch?
Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?
 I whispered in your ear in your dream as you passed out
Baby, was it over then?
And is it over now?

Think I didn't see you? There were flashing lights
At least I had the decency to keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs, and my whispered sighs
Oh Lord, I think about jumping
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come running (Running)
And say the one thing I've been wanting
But no!

(Flashing lights, oh Lord) Let's fast forward to 300 takeout coffees later
(Flashing lights) I was hoping you'd be there
And say the one thing I've been wanting - but no

(ZAYN & Taylor Swift)

Been sittin' eyes wide open behind these four walls, hopin' you'll call
It's just a cruel existence like it's no point hopin' at all

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happenin' to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be livin' in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home

I'm sittin' eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be livin' in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home

I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Baby, baby, I feel crazy)
I see you around in all these empty faces
(Up all night, all night and every day)
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin')
Now I'm in a cab, I tell him where your place is
What is happenin' to me?

I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be livin' in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home

I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home
Until you come back home

“reputation” (released November 10, 2017)



Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?
Oh, are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Eh)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you (I know I'm gonna be with you)
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?



(feat. Ed Sheeran and Future)

I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team (Whoa, whoa, whoa)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (Yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (Git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (Yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

You so dope, don't overdose, I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (Yeah)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Yeah)
I'm in a G5 (Yeah), come to the A-Side (Yeah)
I got a bad boy persona, that's what they like (What they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you're my type (You're my type)
You hold me down and I protect you with my life

I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Wanna be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Hey, big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too

I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips

I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Be your A-Team now, A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (Oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game




I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look—oh—so easy

'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson-red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit
Then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit
'Cause he had it coming

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me

They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, "Don't throw away a good thing."
But if he drops my name
Then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change
Then he had it comin'

They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons

They're burning all the witches, even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)

Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up

They say I did something bad (oh)
Then why's it feel so good? (so good)
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had (most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good (good), good

Oh, you say I did something bad
(You say I did something bad?)
Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (bad)
It just felt so good, good




Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you
I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time."

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (your baby)
Echoes (echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And, baby, for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away
I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh
Every time you're—every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're—every time you're touching me
You're touching me

Every time you're—every time you're loving me

Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
(Using for the rest of my life. Oh!)

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (doing it right, no)
Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

Don't blame me
Love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (you ain't doing it...)
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (I'll be using, I'll be using)

I get so high, oh
Every time you're—every time you're loving me
You're loving me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life




This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Delicate

Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Delicate

Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
Yeah, I want you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Isn't it?)
Delicate




I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (Oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

(Ooh, look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you just made me do)

(Look what you just made me do)
(Look what you made me do)
(Look what you made me do)

(Look what you just made me do)
 (Oh!)

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do

Look what you just made me do




See you in the dark
All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear, and
Cut me into pieces
Gold cage, hostage to my feelings
Back against the wall
Trippin', trip, trippin' when you're gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist
All eyes on us
I make all your grey days clear and
Wear you like a necklace
I'm so chill, but you make me jealous
But I got your heart
Skippin', skip, skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

And all the pieces fall
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep
And I'm yours to lose
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes

You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
I did a number on you
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
You did a number on me
But, honestly, baby, who's counting?
Who's counting?
1, 2, 3

And all the pieces fall (pieces fall)
Right into place
Getting caught up in a moment (caught up, caught up)
Lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep (oh)
And I'm yours to lose (baby)
You know I'm not a bad girl, but I
Do bad things with you
So it goes

Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes
Come here, dressed in black now
So, so, so it goes
Scratches down your back now
So, so, so it goes




Gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you (but you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room (dark room, dark room)
If you got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts
(Honey, it hurts)

Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Yeugh), alone
Unless, you wanna come along? (Oh)

You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face, gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say)
You're gorgeous

You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (It turns back to sad)
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have (What I can have)
You are so gorgeous it makes me so mad (Mmh)
You're gorgeous




No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

 marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lying to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinking
And I was just drinking
Well he was running after us, I was screaming, 'Go, go, go!'
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

 marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

You were driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise, I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win

I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Driving the getaway car
We were flying, but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're riding in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, they never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car

I was riding in a getaway car
I was crying in a getaway car
I was dying in a getaway car
Said 'goodbye' in a getaway car




I'm perfectly fine, I live on my own
I made up my mind, I'm better off being alone
We met a few weeks ago
Now you try on callin' me "baby" like tryin' on clothes

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Late in the night, the city's asleep
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
Change my priorities
The taste of your lips is my idea of luxury

Salute to me I'm your American Queen
And you move to me like I'm a Motown beat
And we rule the kingdom inside my room
(Inside my room, oh)
'Cause all the boys and their expensive cars
With their Range Rovers and their Jaguars
Never took me quite where you do (Where you do)

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul, ooh whoa

And all at once (Hey), I've been waiting, waiting (Waiting)
Ooh, whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one
I have been waiting (Waiting), waiting (Waiting)
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once

Is this the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on the roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
Baby, all at once, this is enough

And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once, you're all I want, I'll never let you go
King of my heart (My heart), body, and soul (My soul), ooh whoa

And all at once, I've been waiting, waiting
Ooh whoa, ooh whoa
And all at once
'Cause you're the one I have been waiting, waiting
Body and soul, ooh whoa
And all at once




I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, 25 years old
Oh, how were you to know and

My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know what

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling
And darling, you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talking, putting us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche?
And say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothing in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feeling

But we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancing
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancing
(Ooh, we had our hands tied)
And I had a bad feeling
But we were dancing

I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swaying as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again)

Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
Oh, yeah, we were dancing
Like it was the first time, first time (First time, first time)
Yeah, we were dancing (Oh)
Dancing with our hands tied, hands tied
(Dancing with our hands tied)
Yeah, we were dancing (Ooh)
And I had a bad feeling (Had a bad feeling)
But we were dancing

(Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
Hands tied, hands tied (Dancing)




Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about—

All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha

Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it oh, ha, ha, ha-ah

There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off




It was so nice throwing big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimming in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier
Feeling so Gatsby for that whole year

So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shaking my hand
And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence

But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Yeah)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have

Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Uh-uh) things (Oh no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling
(And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them
(And here's to my baby)
Nice things, honey
(They didn't care about that he-said, she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things




My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doing better than I ever was

'Cause
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover
Making forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November, holding my breath
Slowly I said, "You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes (would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream
Walking with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)

“Lover” (released August 23, 2019)



How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

But then something happened one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show

But you showed who you are, then one magical night

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah




(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinning like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)




We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my
Lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be over-dramatic and true to my
Lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat
Lover

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover




I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves

And they would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Hey)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man), then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Oh)
I'd be the man (Yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man, then I'd be the man




Combat
I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that
But what if I do?

'Cause cruelty
Wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches
I almost said to you

Easy they come
Easy they go
I jump from the train
I ride off alone
I never grew up
It's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

Dark side
I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright
Right, right, right here?

And I cut off
My nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection
For years and years

I wake in the night
I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire
Invisible smoke
And all of my heroes
Die all alone
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, "Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?"

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

All the king's horses
All the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies
Started out friends
Help me hold on to you

I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me darling...
But who could stay?

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

Combat
I'm ready for combat




I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

He got my heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, oh, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We can follow the sparks, I'll drive

I whisper in the dark

I think he knows

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)
Got that, oh, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)

And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows




You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)
Voted most likely to run away with you

And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win), I just thought you should know

It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl"





The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights, and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4)
Ah

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh huh

I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents except when we went from friends to this
Uh huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings in picture frames in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want




We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar

I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home

And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone

But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I

I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)


I say casually in the car




My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my
My, my, my, my

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not

It's death by a thousand cuts

My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, "I don't know"




We can go driving in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London
Alright, yeah

I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives

You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)

And now I love high tea, stories from Uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy nights in Brixton
Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (Oh)

You know I love a London boy, I enjoy walking SoHo
Drinking in the afternoon (Yeah)
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you (You)
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true (Yeah)
You know I love a London boy (Oh)
Boy (Oh), I fancy you (I fancy you, ooh)

So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
I, I, I fancy you
Oh whoa, oh, I
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney, on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (Ooh)
Wanna be with you
I fancy you (Yeah), I fancy you
Oh whoa, ah



(feat. The Chicks)

The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you

Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping, and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to




We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City, I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love

I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love




You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, "Damn!
It's 7 AM"

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, "Hey!
Are you OK?"

And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned the lesson
That stressing and obsessing
'Bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down"

You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad
When you could be GLAAD?
(You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Just making that sign
Must've taken all night

You just need to take several seats
And then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream
About all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

So, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
Like, can you just not step on his gown
You need to calm down"

And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now
We all got crowns
You need to calm down

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to calm down
(You need to calm down)
You're being too loud
(You're being too loud)
And I'm just like
"Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh!
You need to just stop
(Can you stop?)
Like, can you just not step on our gowns
You need to calm down"




I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh

I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say

Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow



(feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco)

I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Living in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company-e-e-eh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

["Hey, kids.
Spelling is fun!"]

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
But you know there is a "me"
And you can't spell "awesome" without "me"
I promise that you'll never find another like me-e-e-eh

Yeah, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
(And I want you, baby)
I'm the only one of me
(I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh
(Baby, that's the fun of me)

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh

Girl, there ain't no "I" in "team"
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
But you know there is a "me"
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me-e-e-eh

Strike the band up 1, 2, 3
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You can't spell "awesome" without "me"
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e-eh




Ooh
Ooh

School bell rings, walk me home
Sidewalk chalk covered in snow
Lost my gloves, you give me one
 Yeah, sounds like fun
Video games, you pass me a note
Sleeping in tents

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Light pink sky up on the roof
Sun sinks down, no curfew
20 questions, we tell the truth
You've been stressed out lately, yeah, me too
Something gave you the nerve
To touch my hand

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)

Church bells ring, carry me home
Rice on the ground looks like snow
Call my bluff, call you "Babe"
Have my back, yeah, every day
Feels like home, stay in bed
The whole weekend

It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
It's nice to have a friend (Ooh)
(Ooh)




My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (daylight), I only see daylight (daylight)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)
I once believed love would be (Black and white)
But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)
Back and forth from New York (Sneaking in your bed)
I once believed love would be (Burning red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night
(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(I once believed love would be burning red)

Like daylight
It's golden like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go
I wanna be defined by the things that I love
Not the things I hate
Not the things that I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Not the things that haunt me in the middle of the night
I, I just think that
You are what you love




When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
We're sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
And taught you
The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now

Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
We're breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
That's why you're so amazing

All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels like

The girls you loved before (Ooh)
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)
Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more

(I love you more)
(I love you more)




Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones
Are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into

And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe but it's wild and it's free

All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into

And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts




My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress, and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes, and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true

In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We'd run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreaming of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

Under the mistletoe
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"
Just being in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
(Baby, yeah!)

And when I'm feeling alone
You remind me of home
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I'll pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
To you

Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And telling me, "I love you"

Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
(Darling)
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you

Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
(I just want you to know)
Oh baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true

2020



It keeps me awake
The look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside
And frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they're right
You were outnumbered — this time

But only the young
Only the young
Only the young
Only the young can run
Can run, so run
And run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound
You've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly, they forget

They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

Only one thing can save us
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young

Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Only the young (Only the young)
(Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time
Up there's the finish line)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young (Only the young)
Only the young
Can run

Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (Can run)
Up there's the finish line
So run, and run, and run
Don't say you're too tired to fight
It's just a matter of time (So run)
Up there's the finish line
And run, and run, and run

Only the young
Only the young
Only the young


“folklore” (released July 24, 2020)



I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though

I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinee
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the Internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now

I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day, waking up alone

But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Hey, yeah-yeah
I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one




Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends
I, I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleeding

'Cause I knew you
Stepping on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy
I, I knew you
Leaving like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standing in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite




Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"

The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."

Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí

And they said, "There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything."

They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness
Their men and bad habits, and then it was bought by me

Who knows, if I never showed up what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time



(feat. Bon Iver)

I can see you standin', honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defendin' now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh
Hoo, hoo-ooh

I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs
So many signs (You didn't even see the signs)

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you

All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many times) I never learned to read your mind
(So many signs) I couldn't turn things around (I couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (You never gave a warning sign)
You never gave a warning sign
Ah, ah




We gather here
We line up weeping in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire
You'll be made of ashes, too

Even on my worst day
Did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you
I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around saving face
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

We gather stones
Never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw
Some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to
Have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels
That I gave you
As you bury me

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want
Just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame
Drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name
Wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet




I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break it's in a million pieces

Hush
When no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush
When no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush
I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

And they called off the circus
Burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses
And the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
I'm still a believer but I don't know why
I've never been a natural
All I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything
To keep you looking at me

Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball
I'll show you every version of yourself
Tonight




Please picture me
In the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet
In the swing
Over the creek
I was too scared to jump in, but I, I was high
In the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with
Me and we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on

Please picture me
In the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream
Ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long




Salt air
And the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers
Of "Are you sure?"


But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Your back
Beneath the sun
Wishing I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinking I had you

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love, and saying "Us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
No

But I can see us
Lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine, mine

'Cause you were never mine
Never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all


(Remember when I pulled up)
(And said "Get in the car")
(And then canceled my plans)
(Just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was living for the hope of it all)
(For the hope of it all)
("Meet me behind the mall")

Remember when I pulled up
And said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans
Just in case you'd call?
Back when I was living for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
For the hope of it all




I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pourin' out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least I'm trying

And it's hard to be at a party
When I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days
When all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel
On the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying (And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know
That this is me trying

At least I'm trying




Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head
Keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
...a million little times

Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don't even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times

And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings
And stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
...a million little times

And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid"
Don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid"
Don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you I would ruin myself
...a million little times




Green was the color of the grass where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt when you were 16 at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

Time
Curious time
Gave me no compasses
Gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Bad was the blood of the song in the cab on your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer

Time
Mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold tied me to you

Cold was the steel of my axe to grind for the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves when I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven

Time
Wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

(Ah-ah-ah)
(Ah-ah-ah)




What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill and you know I will
You know I will

What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firing at your yacht
They say "move on"
But you know I won't
And women like hunting witches, too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead has really brought you two together

Every time you call me crazy
I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

I'm taking my time
Taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb
Watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin
Has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad
Should be scathing like me
But no one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad

You made her like that




Keep your helmet
Keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound
Here's your rifle

Crawling up the beaches now

And some things you just can't speak about

With you, I serve
With you, I fall down
Down
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out
Out

Something med school
Did not cover
Someone's daughter
Someone's mother

Holds your hand through plastic now

And some things you just can't speak about

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

With you, I serve
With you, I fall down
Down (Down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out
Out

With you, I serve
With you, I serve
With you, I fall down (Down)
Down (Down)
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathe in
Watch you breathin' out (Out)
Out (Out)

Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen




Betty, I won't make assumptions about why you switched your homeroom
But I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing from the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found, I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything but I know I miss you

I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now but, it's finally sinking in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when you see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you

So, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch in front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it? Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen
I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight, you know I miss you




Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?

Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends
It's like I'm wastin' your honor

And you know that I'd
Swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east
Clowns to the West
I'd give you my sunshine
Give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come
If you're standing with me

But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details
But you got a friend in me
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough
If I could never give you peace?




My only one
My smoking gun
My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife
My sleepless night
My winless fight
This has frozen my ground

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming, "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

Stood on the cliffside
Screaming "Give me a reason"
Your faithless love's the only hoax
I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do

You know I left a part of me back in New York
You knew the hero died, so what's the movie for
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password, so I let you in the door
You knew you won, so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart

Don't want no other shade of blue
But you
No other sadness in the world would do




Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you


“evermore” (released December 11, 2020)



I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open/shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a 90's trend

Wait for the signal and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open/shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man




You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure

I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready, so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems




Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in

I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door
At dinner parties
I call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We wandered 'round had never
Seen a love as pure as it
And then it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be

'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipating my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
And I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like
To grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore
At dinner parties
I won't call you out on your contrarian shit
And the coastal town
We never found will never
See a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be
Gleaming
Twinkling
Eyes like sinking ships
On waters so inviting
I almost jump in




If I wanted to know
Who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold
Fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you
Put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

I parked my car
Right between the Methodist and the school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run but only so far
I escaped it too
Remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you
It's okay with me

We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

Sleep in half the day
Just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait
If you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to LA
And the so-called friends who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul who can tell which smiles I'm faking
And the heart I know I'm breaking is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known

We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
'Tis the damn season

We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm staying at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies
Messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown




I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you, I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen, I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser and I

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy shit
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out building other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts in the byline
Always taking up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine
But what would you do if I

Break free and leave us in ruins
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it
I sit and watch you



(feat. HAIM)

He did it
He did it

Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losing sleep
Her husband's acting different and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says

I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die

No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Este wasn't there
Tuesday night at Olive Garden at her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house his truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out
'Cause

I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't letting up until the day I die
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was 15
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me ("She was with me dude")
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy

They think she did it but they just can't prove it
They think she did it but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it but she just can't prove it

No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't letting up until the day he
Died




Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots
I was dancing when the music stopped
And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet

There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him, too

Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that

There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you, too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness




Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me?
When we were younger
Down in the park
Honey, making a lark of the misery
You got shiny friends since you left town
A tiny screen's the only place I see you now
And I got nothing but well wishes for ya

Oooh
This place is the same as it ever was
Oooh
But you won't like it that way

It's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know that you'll always know me
Dorothea
Dorothea

Ooh, you're a queen
Selling dreams
Selling make-up and magazines
Ooh, from you I'd buy anything

Hey Dorothea
Do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer
Skipping the prom
Just to piss off your mom
And her pageant schemes
And damn, Dorothea
They all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul
I met under the bleachers? Well

Oooh
I guess I'll never know
Oooh
And you'll go on with the show

But it's never too late
To come back to my side
The stars in your eyes
Shined brighter in Tupelo
And if you're ever tired of being known
For who you know
You know you'll always know me

Dorothea
Dorothea

Oooh
Oooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Oooh
Oooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Dorothea



(feat. The National)

Break my soul in two
Looking for you but you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?

And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

The question pounds my head

If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'Cause we were like the mall before the Internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line by the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest gray?
A universe away
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name

I'm on a bench in Coney Island wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Over and over

Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
When the sun goes down

The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Over and over
Sorry for not making you my
Making you my
Making you my centerfold




How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground

How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you

So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you
In you
Now I'm covered in you
In you




And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, "Dancin' is a dangerous game."

Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

You're a cowboy like me

Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life
Never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
But that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again




Fatefully
I tried to pick my battles
'Til the battle picked me
Misery
Like the war of words I shouted in my sleep
And you passed right by
I was in the alley surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it
'Til your high heels break

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view
Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to
When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door
And we live in peace
But if someone comes at us
This time I'm ready

'Cause I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you
I'm all about you

No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
No more tug of war
Now I just know there's more (Know there's more)
No more keepin' score
Now I just keep you warm (Keep you warm)
And my waves meet your shore
Ever and evermore

Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses will defeat themselves
Before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it
Everywhere you go

And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Climbed right back up the cliff
Long story short, I survived
Now I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
(And now) I'm all about you
(And now) I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you
(And now) Yeah, yeah
I'm all about you

Long story short, it was a bad time
Long story short, I survived




Never be so kind, you forget to be clever
Never be so clever, you forget to be kind

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

Never be so polite, you forget your power
Never wield such power, you forget to be polite

And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive

The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me

What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
I know better
But I still feel you all around
I know better
But you're still around




It's been a long time
And seeing the shape of your name
Still spells out pain
It wasn't right
The way it all went down
Looks like you know that now

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"

Don't treat me like some situation that needs to be handled
I'm fine with my spite
And my tears
And my beers and my candles
I can feel you smoothing me over

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"
Your "closure"

I know I'm just a
Wrinkle in your new life
Staying "friends"
Would iron it out so nice
Guilty, guilty reaching out across the sea
That you put between you and me
But it's fake
And it's oh so unnecessary

Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
It cut deep to know ya
Right to the bone
Yes, I got your letter
Yes, I'm doing better
I know that it's over
I don't need your "closure"

Your "closure"
Your "closure"

Gray November
I've been down since July
Motion capture
Put me in a bad light

I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong
Writing letters
Addressed to the fire

And I was catching my breath
Staring out an open window
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

Hey December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for

I rewind the tape but all it does is pause
On the very moment all was lost
Sending signals
To be double-crossed

And I was catching my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter
Catching my death
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore
(Evermore)

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again
Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days
I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost)
I thought of you (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you (To be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the costs)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
I swear (Is there a line that we could just go cross?)
You were there

And I was catching my breath
Floors of a cabin creaking under my step
And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for
Evermore
Evermore
Evermore
This pain wouldn't be for evermore
Evermore




Friends break up, friends get married
Strangers get born, strangers get buried
Trends change, rumors fly through new skies
But I'm right where you left me
Matches burn after the other
Pages turn and stick to each other
Wages earned and lessons learned
But I'm right where you left me

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight," I
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop
Right when I felt the moment stop
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared
Right where you left me

You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever

Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
And you're sitting in front of me

At the restaurant when I was still the one you want
Cross-legged in the dim light
Everything was just right, I
I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone
Glass shattered on the white cloth
Everybody moved on

Help, I'm still at the restaurant
Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, "What a sad sight," I
I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas, but I'm unaware
'Cause I'm right where
I cause no harm
Mind my business
If our love died young
I can't bear witness
And it's been so long
But if you ever think you got it wrong

I'm right where
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me
You left me no, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever




When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab
Or that moment again he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that
When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Twenty years at your job
Then the son of the boss gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids
When keeping it how it is will only break their hearts worse

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul
You know when it's time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

Fifteen years, fifteen million tears
Begging 'til my knees bled
I gave it my all, he gave me nothing at all
Then wondered why I left
Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me

That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes giving up is the strong thing
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
Sometimes walking out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
You know in your soul
When it's time to go
You know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go
So then you go
Then you go
You just go

(Big Red Machine feat. Taylor Swift)

I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you
Was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay
But I stayed anyway
And if I would've known
How many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay

Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage, damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history

It's time, you've come a long way
Open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade
To need somebody

Is it insensitive for me to say
Get your shit together
So I can love you?
Is it really your anxiety
That stops you from giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?

I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you
Was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay
But I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave

Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
Let all your damage, damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history

It's time, you've come a long way
Open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade
To need somebody

Is it insensitive for me to say
Get your shit together
So I can love you?
Is it really your anxiety
That stops you from giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?

And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were
You'd crumbled into
I might've let them lay

Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage, damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history

It's time, you've come a long way
Open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade
To need somebody

To need somebody
I need somebody
To need somebody
To need somebody

(Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?)
Is it insensitive for me to say
(And let all your damage, damage me)
Get your shit together
(And carry your baggage up my street)

O Carolina creeks
Running through my veins
Lost I was born
Lonesome I came
Lonesome I'll always stay

Carolina knows
Why for years I roam
Free as these birds
Light as whispers
Carolina knows

And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here

And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

Carolina stains
On the dress she left
Indelible scars
Pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled

Carolina pines
Won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes
Down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave

And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me

And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

And you didn't see me here
They never did see me here
No, you didn't see me here
They never saw me

O Carolina knows
Why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin
And sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast
And I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me
The sand and the sea
Carolina knows


“Midnights” (released October 21, 2022)



Meet me at midnight
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia
I've been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Ooh ooh ooh whoa

All they keep asking me
(All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see
(Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh yeah)

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
That lavender haze

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
(Get it off my desk)

Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk

I feel (I feel) the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal (No deal)
The 1950s' shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

Ooh ooh ooh whoa
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
That lavender haze
I just wanna stay
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze




When the morning came, we
Were cleaning incense off your
Vinyl shelf 'cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend

You say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw top rosé
That's how"
I see you every day now

And I chose you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

When the silence came, we
Were shaking blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses
That's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up

And I lost you
The one I was dancing with in New York
No shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was maroon
The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy, legacy
(It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fuckin' legacy to leave

The burgundy on my t-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet
It was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

It was maroon
It was maroon




I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out


It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (Hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero



(feat. Lana Del Rey)

One night a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched 'aurora borealis green'
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it till you make it
Till you do
Till it's true

Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, oh

I can't speak, afraid to jinx it
I don't even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing, can it?

Are we falling like
Snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me tonight, feels impossible
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow
But it's comin' down, no sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
Like snow on the beach
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(It's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)
(Down, it's coming down, it's coming down, it's coming down)




Summer went away
Still the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently
He's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway

I hear it in your voice
You're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town
I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

I see the great escape
So long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed
Writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been




Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice

He was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away

'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
Midnights like this




(I remember)

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing going on
I swear that it was something
'Cause I don't remember who I was before you
Painted all my nights
A color I have searched for since
But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications and I
Have to say
By the way
I just may like some explanations

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind
With some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on something
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

Does it feel like everything's just like second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard, that you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right
But tonight

Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was making fun of you (You, making fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later they were clapping too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question




Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one will be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge

She needed cold hard proof so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Driving in your Benz
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately she's been dressing for revenge

Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doing lines
And crossing all of mine
Someone told his white collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately I've been dressing for revenge




Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walking all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Putting someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way
I'm going out tonight

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl
Too good of a girl
Did all the extra credit then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world
Have you heard?
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you
But I miss sparkling

(Nice) Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real
I polish up real nice
Nice

Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice)
I polish up real nice

And we're dancing all night
And you can try
To change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer




It only hurts this much right now
Was what I was thinking the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be getting over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love
Oh no, I'm falling in love again
Oh, I'm falling in love
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

Uh oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
Oh no, I'm falling in love again (falling in love again)
Oh, I'm falling in love (falling in love)
I thought the plane was going down
How'd you turn it right around?

(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)
(You know how much I hate it)




You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me

'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm
Karma's a relaxing thought




I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
Ooh
Ooh

'Cause they said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Nothing

Industry disrupters and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters
Out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore

To you I can admit
That I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is coming
Everyone's up to something
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving
You're in the kitchen humming
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing

They said the end is coming (They said the end is coming)
Everyone's up to something (Everyone's up to something)
I find myself running home to your
Sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shoving (Outside, they're push and shoving)
You're in the kitchen humming (You're in the kitchen humming)
All that you ever wanted from me was
Sweet nothing




Once upon a time, the planets and the fates and all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room at the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You see all the wisest women had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn in every lover's game
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

What if I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork and then just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian 'cause I care

So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me, nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork and then saw a wide smirk
On your face, you knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind




My knuckles were bruised like violets
Sucker punching walls
Cursed you as I sleep talked
Spineless in my tomb of silence
Tore your banners down
Took the battle underground
And maybe it was egos swinging
Maybe it was her
Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
Tears on the letter, I vowed
Not to cry anymore
If we survived the Great War

You drew up some good faith treaties
I drew curtains closed
Drank my poison all alone
You said I have to trust more freely
But diesel is desire
You were playing with fire
And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt
Telling me to punish you for things you never did
So I justified it

All that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the bombs were closer
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
The burning embers, I vowed
Not to fight anymore
If we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh

It turned into something bigger
Somewhere in the haze
Got a sense I'd been betrayed
Your finger on my hairpin triggers
Soldier down on that icy ground
Looked up at me with honor and truth
Broken and blue
So I called off the troops
That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you

We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer
Place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory
It was war, it wasn't fair
And we will never go back to that

Bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War
Always remember, uh-huh
We're burned for better, I vowed
I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh, uh-huh
I will always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War
Uh-huh
I vowed I will always be yours




No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you

Did some bird flap its wings over in Asia?
Did some force take you because I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you

What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
(What could've been, would've been you)

Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you




"Your ex-friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable
Did you see the photos?"
No, I didn't, but thanks, though

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours
Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown

I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne
I was taken by the view

Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else

I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever
I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters
Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight
In my mind

We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne

'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else




Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it
High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?

Storm coming
Good husband
Bad omen
Dragged my feet right down the aisle
At the house lonely
Good money
I'd pay, if you'd just know me
Seemed like the right thing at the time

You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough
Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to tell you how he brought me back to life?

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Do you really want to know where I was April 29th?
Do I really have to chart the constellations in his eyes?
You know there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
The slowest way is never loving them enough

High infidelity
Put on your records and regret meeting me
I bent the truth too far tonight
I was dancing around, dancing around it

High infidelity
Put on your headphones and burn my city
Your picket fence is sharp as knives
I was dancing around, dancing around it

Oh, there's many different ways that you can kill the one you love
And it's never enough, it's never enough

Lock broken
Slur spoken
Wound open
Game token
I didn't know you were keeping count
Rain soaking
Blind hoping
You said I was freeloading
I didn't know you were keeping count
But, oh, you were keeping count




We were supposed to be just friends
You don't live in my part of town but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situation-ship I'm in
And what's in my system

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground
But it's been 2,190 days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)

I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch, ah-yeah

A brief interruption
A slight malfunction
I'd go back to wanting
Dudes who give nothing
I thought we had no chance
And that's romance
Let's dance

Glitch, ah-yeah
Five seconds later I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, ah-yeah
And I'm not even sorry
Nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch




If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
If I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?
Oh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

If you never touched me I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us
Oh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe

I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first

And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen, and the god's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know
I wish you'd left me wondering

God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

Oh, god rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time




Dear reader, if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run
Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart (You should find another)

Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to
Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you
(You should find another)
Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets
Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss

Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart

So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight
My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free
But darling, darling, please
You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking
If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire

You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)
Find another, you should find another
You should find another




I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)

I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town like an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summer then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different
It hits different 'cause it's you

('Cause it's you)

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl

I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different this time
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different 'cause it's you

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
'Cause it's you
Catastrophic blues
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different (Yeah)
It hits different 'cause it's you




You say, "I don't understand" and I say, "I know you don't"
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time

Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore... for you
'Cause you're losing me

Every mornin' I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick

And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're running down the hallway
And you know what they all say


Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore... for you
'Cause you're losing me
'Cause you're losing me
Stop (Stay) 'cause you're losing me

My heart won't start anymore (Stop 'cause you're losing me)
My heart won't start anymore (Stop 'cause you're losing me)

How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (You're losing me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fading, thinkin'
 (Say something)
 (You're losing me)
 (I got nothing)


You're losing me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losing me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losing me
I can't find a pulse, my heart won't start anymore

The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you





One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
All the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart
Ohhh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying
Oh my ohhh, well I ain't!

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be moving on

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she like's everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own





'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be moving on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she like's everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I fear nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill





Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
You are the one, girl
You know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too





In the summer, as the lilacs blew
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same





'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby we found love right where we are

And we found love right where we are
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as this skyline splits in two
Miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wonder do you see them too?

So open your eyes and see, the way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead, into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing \"Chasing Cars\" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were laying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through London's streets and knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
Hear the song our heart is beating to?





So open your eyes and see the way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

And all
And all
And all
I can see the stars from America
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could have been the medicine
And now you\u2019re lying in the bed again
Either way I\u2019ll cry with the rest of them.

And my father told me, \u201cSon,
It\u2019s not his fault he doesn\u2019t know your face,
And you\u2019re not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, that he used to sing

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside, a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we\u2019re wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they\u2019re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we\u2019re set alight, we\u2019re afire love, love, love oh.





Things were all good yesterday
Then the devil took your breath away
And now we\u2019re left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie standin' in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend.
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen
Six years old I remember when.

And my father told me, \u201cSon,
It\u2019s not his fault he doesn\u2019t know your face,
And you\u2019re not the only one.
Although my grandma used to say, he used to say\u2026

Darling hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside, a little while he wrote
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we\u2019re wrapped in light, in life, in love.
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they\u2019re designed to be together oh
With your body next to mine our hearts will beat as one
And we\u2019re set alight, we\u2019re afire love, love, love oh

And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And my mother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing halellujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
And all of my brothers and my sisters, yeah
And my father and all of my family
Rise from the seats to sing hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Bibia be ye ye
I lost my shoes last night
I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar upon my knuckle
And each grass upon my knee, and all I know is
I got a call and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me always say what's on your mind
And I am only being hones wirh you, I, I get lonely
And make mistakes from time to time
So [?] make ya'(if things aren't getting working out)
Bibia be ye ye (everything will be alright)
Bibia be ye ye ye ye ye ye ye
Bibia be ye ye

I remember less and less and mostly things I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the [?] and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right down to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town
And spend the afternoon looking around for things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day





Someone told me always say what's on your mind
And I am only being hones with you, I, I get lonely
And make mistakes from time to time
So [?] (if things aren't going well)

Making me feel like the beat and the bassline

Get lost in the rhythm of me

I\u2019ve been spinning out for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I\u2019ve been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded
How'd I get so faded
Oh
No no don\u2019t leave me lonely now

Fading out again

Thought I\u2019d find her in a bottle
God make me another one

I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon her, Broken hearted lover
Oh

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I

Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill





Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when

We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to \"Tiny Dancer\"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home

And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Ah-la-la-la-la
Ah-la-la-la-la
I met this girl late last year
She said don\u2019t you worry if I disappear
I told her I\u2019m not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We\u2019ll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should\u2019ve just said
She\u2019s singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don\u2019t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don\u2019t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don\u2019t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don\u2019t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she\u2019s staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I don\u2019t want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what it\u2019s about
But maybe we\u2019ll go together and just figure it out
I\u2019d rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we\u2019ll be missing it now
Wish I\u2019d have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him
How? I was confused about
She should figure it out while I\u2019m sat here singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don\u2019t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don\u2019t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don\u2019t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don\u2019t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
*Knock knock knock* on my hotel door
I don\u2019t even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn\u2019t need to take him to bed that\u2019s all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It\u2019s not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn\u2019t looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize what you wanted
It\u2019s a bit too much, too late if I\u2019m honest
All this time God knows I\u2019m singing
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don\u2019t fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don\u2019t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
Don\u2019t fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don\u2019t wanna know that babe
Ah-la-la-la-la
       "lyrics": "",
[Ed Sheeran]
Waking up, half past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should've seen the other guy

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles that's why

In my dark times I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Don't think my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times





[The Weeknd]
Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still calming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But an endless fog's the life I chose

This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Baby I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
Running in circles that's why

In my dark times I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times

In my dark times I've still got some problems I know
Driving to fast but just moving to slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go
Pulling me back every time

In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would not keep
In my dark times this is all I could be
Only my mother could of loved me for me
In my dark times, in my dark times
In my dark times
Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you





You're a mystery
I have travelled the world, there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history?
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mm

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake everyday
Don't know how much I can take
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I've made
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all.
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to.

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me.

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love





I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to.

There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore.

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make.

Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love.

All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love.
I was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, they kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And everyday that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow





I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am not beyond my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngling
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

Singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I wish my family and friends they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run to
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, \"Fuck you\"
I wish I was home more
I wish my teens could see the kids on the birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grow more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressin' 'cause
Every day this shit gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on eraser blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait

Singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish

I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat cold
Mum sayin', \"Don't smoke,\" no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit, quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick, with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me work hard and you can never be shit
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wish
It\u2019s alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don\u2019t wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you\u2019re alive
It\u2019s alright to die
Cause death's the only thing you haven\u2019t tried
But just for tonight hold on

So live life like you\u2019re giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It\u2019s alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside the rage Against the dying of the light
It\u2019s alright to say that death\u2019s the only thing you haven\u2019t tried
But just for today hold on





So live life like you\u2019re giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

So live life like your giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart hold on

So live life like your giving up
Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart hold on
I didn't mean to break your heart
I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you've found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight
I wish I never called you up
Nobody told me
And they don't know, they don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
Won't you just hold me tonight
And I would stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not, anything like a voice
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah, yeah

Cause maybe I don't want to lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's right
I shouldn't have f*cked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my true loves, everything you are

I never meant to sleep around
I was just lonely
You did the same, again, and again
I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight
Oh I would stop trying to fall in love again
And keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not, anything like a voice
Cause you were the only one for me
Yeah





Cause maybe I don't want to lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's right
I shouldn't have f*cked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my true loves, everything you are

When I see my future
It is with you
We'll get there
I want my children to be with you together

Cause maybe I don't want to lose a lover and friend in one night
If that's right
I shouldn't have f*cked with your mind
And your life too many times
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely
Darling you are my only love
Behind my true loves, everything you are
Behind my true loves, everything you are
Behind my true loves, everything you are
We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
I never know, no one wants it to

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you





We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through

So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you

But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why

Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends should kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you
Oh, my friends will never love me like you
They say boys don't cry
But your daddy shed a lot of tears
They say I should be a strong man
But baby, I'm still filled with fear
Sometimes I don't know who I am
Sometimes I question why I'm here
I just wanna be a good dad
Will I be? I have no idea
They say girls shouldn't be tough
And moms should raise their kids at home
But baby, I know that that isn't true
Cause your momma's the toughest person I know
I wanna raise you to be like her
And watch you show the world how to do it on your own
I'm still tryna figure out who I am
I don't wanna mess this up or do this wrong
I'm gonna be there for your first breath
I don't know if I'll be there for your first step
I can promise you that I'll try to work less
But the tour's routed, and I got this album
Put in so many hours, and I just want the outcome
To be something that I can look back and I can be proud of
Don't wanna be a dad that's living in FaceTime
But I've got a world to sing to and you at the same time
I won't spoil you, you can trust that
For your sweet 16, you get a bus pass
Had your heart broken? Been there, done that
I love you and I can't give you enough of that
Get back to community that raised you up
Read Langston Hughes, I suggest \"A Raisin in the Sun\"
Listen to Sam Cooke, a change gon' come
You put the work in, don't worry about the praise, my love
Don't try to change the world, find something that you love
And do it every day
Do that for the rest of your life
And eventually, the world will change

[Ed Sheeran]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up

I recommend that you read The Alchemist
Listen to your teachers, but cheat in calculus
Tell the truth, regardless of the consequence
And every day, give your momma a compliment
Take your girl to the prom
But don't get too drunk hanging out the limo
Slow dance with your woman in your arms
Sneak her in after but boy, you better tiptoe
Don't wake your mom up, do yoga, learn 'bout karma
Find God, but leave the dogma
The quickest way to happiness? Learning to be selfless
Ask more questions, talk about yourself less
Study David Bowie, James Bowen and 2Pac
Watch the sun set with best friends from a rooftop
Wear a helmet, don't be stupid
Jaywalk, but look before you do it
If it snows, go outside, build a jump, get some help
Get a sled, thrash the hill with your friends till it melts
Go to festivals, camp, fall in love, and dance you're only young once, my love won, this is your chance
Take risks, cuz life moves so fast. You're only young once, my love won, this is your chance





[Ed]
I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up

I'll be patient, one more month
You'll wrap your fingers round my thumb
Times are changing, I know, but who am I if
I'm the person you become
If I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up, up, up, up
I'm still growing up
Give me love like her,
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone,
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,
Told you I'd let them go,

And that I'll fight my corner,
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, give me love,





Give me love like never before,
'Cause lately I've been craving more,
And it's been a while but I still feel the same,
Maybe I should let you go,

You know I'll fight my corner,
And that tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood is drowning in alcohol,
No, I just wanna hold ya.

Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,

Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love,
My, my, my, my, oh give me love.

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover.

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover,
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (love me, love me, love me).

M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love),
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love),
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love, love me),
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover (give me love).

My, my, my, my, oh give me love,

My, my, my, my, oh give me love.

[Hidden track \"The Parting Glass\"]

Of all the money that e'er I had
I've spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance

I saw her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table, with Johnny riding as a shotgun
Chilled some more one more drink at the bar
Then say I'm on the jukebox, got to dance, you know

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl





You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing to C\u00e8ilidh singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sing so sweet
A capella in the bar wring her feet for the beat
Oh, I could have that while playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

Now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
Finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm going to pot you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said baby I just want to dance
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
None like most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know...

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

She is the river flowin' nowhere
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know





But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Well, I've found love inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought growing old
'Cause from now until I go

Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
Oh we're in love, aren't we?
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah...
You are the one, girl
You know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked but

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too





In the summer, as the lilacs blew
Blood flows deeper than a river
Every moment that I spend with you

We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too

We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we shouldn't had asked

How would you feel
If I told you I loved you
It's just something that I want to do
I'm taking my time, spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arms
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier

Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new





'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Sat on the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier
Aren't you?

Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you

But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'd feel it too
I know I could smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you

Baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waiting\u00a0here for you...
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's son

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky





Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

Oh, should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me

And if the night is burning
I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then
My brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze

I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire)
I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire)
And I see fire (fire)
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
[Verse 1: Tori Kelly]
A dangerous plan, just this time
A stranger's hand clutched in mine
I'll take this chance, so call me blind
I've been waiting all my life

[Pre-Chorus: Tori Kelly]
Please don't scar this young heart
Just take my hand

[Chorus: Tori Kelly]
I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you





[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
Hold me close through the night
Don't let me go, we'll be alright
Touch my soul and hold it tight
I've been waiting all my life

[Pre-Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I won't scar your young heart
Just take my hand

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran]
Cause I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you

[Bridge: Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran]
Please don't go, I've been waiting so long
Oh, you don't even know me at all
But I was made for loving you

[Chorus: Tori Kelly & Ed Sheeran]
I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you
Ooh I\u2019m a mess right now
Inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender
But this is not the end
I can\u2019t work it out
How?
Going through the motions
Going through us
And though I've known it for the longest time
And all my hope
All my words are all over written on the signs
But you\u2019re my road walking me home
Home, home

See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I\u2019m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

I messed up this time
Late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion
With fingers intertwined
I can\u2019t shake this feeling now
We\u2019re going through the motions
Hoping you'd stop
And though I\u2019ve only caused you pain
You know with all of my words
With all this beloved
Although all the lies spoke
When you\u2019re my road walking me home
Home, home, home





See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love
Easy baby maybe I\u2019m a light
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach

And for how long I\u2019ve loved my lover
For how long I\u2019ve loved my lover
And now, for how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
Now now, for how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
(And I feel loved)
For how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
For how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
Now, now, for how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
Feel it all over now
For how long I\u2019ve loved my lover
Now now
For how long, long I\u2019ve loved my lover
[Ed Sheeran]
All alone as you look through the door
Nothing left to see
If it hurts and you can't take no more
Lay it all on me

No you don't have to keep it on a locking key
Cause I will never let you down
And if you can't escape of your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me
You can lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me





If you're scared when you're out on your own
Just remember me
Cause I won't let you go, let alone
Lay it all on me

No you don't have to keep it on a locking key
Cause I will never let you down
And if you can't escape of your uncertainties
Baby I can show you how

Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me
You can lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me

So if you're hurting babe
Just let you're heart be free
You got a friend in me
I'll be your shoulder at anytime you need
Baby I believe
So if you're hurting babe
Just let you're heart be free
I'll be your shoulder at anytime you need
Baby I believe
You can lay it all on me

Let my love in, let my love in
Lay your heart on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me (lay it all on me)
Lay it all on me (lay it all on me)
Lay it all on me
If you're hurting, if you're hurting
Lay it all on me (lay it all on me)
Lay it all, lay it all
Lay it all (lay it all on me)
Lay it all, lay it all
Lay it all on me
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Lay it all, lay it all on me
Lay it all on me
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots, with the freckles on your cheeks
And it al makes sense to me

I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you
They add up to, I'm in love with you
And all these little things





You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never love the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you
They add up to, I'm in love with you
And all these little things

You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
You'll never treat yourself right darlin'
But I want you to
If I let you know I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, ohhh

I've just let these little things out of my mouth
Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you
They add up to, and I'm in love with you
And all these little things

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you
They add up to, I'm in love with you
And all your little things
All the times that you rain on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart
Ohhh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying
Oh my ohhh, well I ain't!

And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be moving on

And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she like's everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job
Didn't see what's going on
But now I know
I'm better sleeping on my own





'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

When you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from

And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care, I don't
But, you still hit my phone up
And baby I be moving on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she like's everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love now I fear nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself

'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Ohhhh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
I'm gonna pick up the pieces,
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down

My three words have two meanings,
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now





I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall

And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take

And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you better now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I will love you better now
[Ed Sheeran]
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
Even though
I know this fire brings me pain
Even so
I'm just the same

Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

And the seed needs the water
Before it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hotter
And the hunger more profound
Well I know there can come tears from their eyes
But they may as well be in vain
Even though
I know these tears bring me pain
Even so
I'm just the same





Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down low
Just make it rain
Make it rain

Make it rain (x8)

And the seas are full of water
That stop by the shore
Just like the riches of grandeur
That never reach the port

So let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let the lightning be the veins
And fill the sky
With all that they can drop
When it's time
To make a change
[Verse 1]
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us

[Pre-Hook]
And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Hook]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach





[Verse 2]
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling, now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop

[Pre-Hook 2]
And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home

[Hook]
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
Before tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach

[Outro]
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover, now, now? x3 (and I feel love)
For how long long I love my lover? (feel it all over now now and I feel love) x5
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long long I love my lover?
I was twenty-four years old when I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty two grand kids now growing old in that house that your brother bought ya
Oh the summer day when I proposed, I made that wedding ring from [?] gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, \"No, you won't marry my daughter\"

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the wexford border

Will I met her at [Guy's?] in the second world war
She was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The second that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters





She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the wexford border

From her snow white in her [?] and jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
That's the difference, I \u00a0assure ya

She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan, and I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the wexford border
I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play the guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
And any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And Re: Stacks is what the speakers play
I\u2019ll be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites, we needed no breathe
We used each others edge just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And also you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don\u2019t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way God made us
And time\u2019s the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
\u2018Cause I ain\u2019t ever coming home
Nina, oh, won\u2019t you leave me now
And I\u2019ve been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that\u2019s you and me both
Nina, oh, won\u2019t you leave me now
Now

And every weekend in the winter
You\u2019d be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we be on the road
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish
Back to the borrow with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can\u2019t help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you\u2019ll be in between forever
So I guess we\u2019ll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I\u2019m not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it\u2019s too late
So we kinda need to deal with the pain
Or wait to get on the plane
But in the day we\u2019ll have to say it again





Oh Nina
You should go Nina
\u2018Cause I ain\u2019t ever coming home
Nina, oh, won\u2019t you leave me now
And I\u2019ve been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that\u2019s you and me both
Nina, oh, won\u2019t you leave me now
Now

Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won\u2019t you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, oh oh won\u2019t you leave me now

Oh Nina
You should go Nina
\u2018Cause I ain\u2019t ever coming home
Nina, oh, won\u2019t you leave me now
And I\u2019ve been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that\u2019s you and me both
Nina, oh, won\u2019t you leave me now
Now
No, no, no, no, no

I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Louis Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to me
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me





Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to M\u00e1laga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says, \"Cheya!\", boy never light up the room
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisp, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought that I would tell you, 'cause oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to me
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me

But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man
[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
Give me your old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...

[Hook x2: Ed Sheeran]
As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 1: Lupe Fiasco]
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
Wassup





As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

[Verse 2: Lupe Fiasco]
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melli Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a trap, and if you want it (eeeeeeeh)
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past
Wassup.

[Verse 3: Lupe Fiasco]
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Now I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Wassup...

[Bridge: Ed Sheeran]
Give me your old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

As long as I'm here
As long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Tell me that you turned down the man
Who asked for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
Just stay with me

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if, we see this through
You could stay within these walls or leave
But just stay with me





All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one

I'm stumbling out drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way you home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong?

All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home





Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die

We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won\u2019t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home

You can keep me
Inside the necklace you bought when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
That's okay baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages you just hold me
And I won\u2019t ever let you go

When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come home
I found a love for me
Darling just dive right in, and follow my lead
Well I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this time
But darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know and
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
I know\u00a0 we'll be alright this time
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes





Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect,\u00a0 I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don\u2019t wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do I wanna runaway
Runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well dad just don\u2019t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It\u2019s been a long day
Thumb on side of the roadway

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don\u2019t wanna live in his home
There\u2019s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I\u2019ll just runaway and be on my own.





I\u2019ve never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet.
And this is what I\u2019m gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes, and when it\u2019s morning, go

How long you leaving?
Well dad just don\u2019t expect me back this evening
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this
It\u2019s been a long day
Thumb on side of the roadway

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don\u2019t wanna live in his home.
There\u2019s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I\u2019ll just runaway and be on my own.

Back pack, and a flat cap, turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn\u2019t down with that plan to attack intends to show love.
I don\u2019t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
Could be persuaded to hold up
And mama was the same
None of us are saints
And I guess that God knows that
I don\u2019t wanna runaway
And one of these days I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoelaces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder

But I love him from the skin to my bones
But I don\u2019t wanna live in his home
There\u2019s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I\u2019ll just runaway and be on my own.
Rewind repeat it

Stay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll call it mine
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?
Cause I'll find the faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind repeat it

Rewind repeat it





If the world ends tonight
You'll me in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My love is streaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind repeat it

Rewind repeat it

Just close your eyes
All you need to see
It's your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
Cause they will tell you apart from the sins
If the darkness creeps in
Rewind repeat it
Rewind repeat it

If the world ends tonight
You'll me in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My love is streaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind repeat it

Rewind repeat it
It\u2019s late in the evening
Glass on the side I\u2019ve
Been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don\u2019t wanna know
If you\u2019re getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man\u2019s land
For the longest time lady

I need you darling, come on set the tone
If you feel you\u2019re falling, won\u2019t you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing





This love is a blaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I wrote a change singing we found love in a local rave
I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said it\u2019s nice to meet ya
And then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know she\u2019s a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I\u2019m in deep
If anybody finds out I\u2019m meant to drive home
But I drunk all of it now, no
Sobering up
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another
Now she\u2019s kissing my mouth

I need you darling, Come on set the tone
If you feel you\u2019re falling, Won\u2019t you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe

Sing
Louder
Sing

Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don\u2019t even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the band
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so won't you take my hand
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?

I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you\u2019re falling
Won\u2019t you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you  from your head to toe
Say you love me to my face
I need it more than your embrace
Just say you want me, that's all it takes
Heart's getting torn from your mistakes

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating

Just say you love me, just for today
And don't give me time 'cause that's not the same
Want to feel burning flames when you say my name
Want to feel passion flow into my bones
Like blood through my veins





'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try,
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away

Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
Slowly slowly you run for me,
But do you know me at all?
Some one told me love controls everything
But only if you know

'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
(No no no no)
If you don't wanna try
(Try sometime)\u00a0
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
(You might)
'Cause I don't wanna fall in love
If you don't wanna try
But all that I've been thinking of
Is maybe that you might
Baby it looks as though we're running out of words to say
And love's floating away
Won't you stay?
Won't you stay?
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breath
I gave many my money and now we don't even speak
I drive miles and miles but would you do the same for me
Oh, honestly?
Offered up my shoulder just for you to cry upon\u00a0
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a wing
Its goes on and on and on

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to [?] or drink
What time do we stand upon come have it looks the same?
And only scars remain





Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf my farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

But if don't then I'll go back to where I'm becoming a stranger
Just because they ended being just like that
Oh, I'm here again between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's hust of nature
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song, but it helps
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf, my farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed\u00a0up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger been down the sink
Dad always told me, \"Don't you cry when you're down\"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink

Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home





I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face

I hope that I see the world as you did cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah
You're home
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I'll know that
When God took you back he said Hallelujah
You're home...
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking faster and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop
Put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you





One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty
So go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i\u2014oh\u2014i
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on

Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Cafe clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight

I drill you deep into my chest
That\u2019s where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
\u2018cause I don\u2019t want to be alone

\u2018cause everyday that I\u2019m breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won\u2019t you sing another song





Caf\u00e9 clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we\u2019re only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes

With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue,
\u2018Cause I don\u2019t want to be alone

\u2018Cause everyday that I\u2019m breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won\u2019t you me sing another song

Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song

Mary Jane,
I\u2019ve been hoping alone
Mary Jane,
Since you came along
Mary Jane,
I\u2019m almost home
Mary Jane,
Sing another song

\u2018Cause everyday that I\u2019m breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won\u2019t you me sing another song

\u2018Cause everyday that I\u2019m breathing, sweet Mary Jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet Mary Jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won\u2019t you sing me another song
I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You\u2019ll be sinking in
So we\u2019ll learn to swim in the ocean
You made to hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you\u2019ll be floating away
And I\u2019ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I\u2019m captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The salted tears won\u2019t dry
I\u2019ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I\u2019ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes,your eyes

I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss bitterness
And I drown within the ocean you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs cover in your make up
I\u2019ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I\u2019ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I\u2019m captain of this sinking boat, now
We just want all men to carry me home
The salted tears won\u2019t dry
I\u2019ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I\u2019ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact design
I\u2019m on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I\u2019m drowning in the ocean you made

The salted tears won\u2019t dry
I\u2019ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I\u2019ll wipe my shirtsleeves
Under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, you eyes
You're just a small bump unborn, in four months you're brought to life,
You might be left with my hair, but you'll have your mother's eyes,
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can, but for now your scan of my unmade plans,
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

I'll whisper quietly, and give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
Oh, you are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.





You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin.
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin.
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice,
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes.

And I'll hold you tightly, and give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me, I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
Oh, you are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.

You can lie with me,
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep,
I'll leave you be.
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe.

'Cause you are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
You are my one and only.
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb and hold me tight.
And you'll be alright.

You were just a small bump unborn for four months then torn from life.
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why.
You're just a small bump unborn, in four months you're brought to life,

Hmm yeah your burn me
You can
Well I don't know wanna know you've been
I was your new best friend
Do you know I'll treat you like them
I know

You're under my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These cars were the way that you left me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These cars were the way that you left me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No i, I couldn't live without you
Tears at night could drive but I know
I'm burning right the wire and lifeboats
You could be in the way you play me





And I know

You're under my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These cars were the way that you left me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These cars were the way that you left me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

See these cars leaving blood on my little white dress
Leaving hard, heal me now

You're under my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These cars were the way that you left me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Burning in my bloodstream
These cars were the way that you left me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same





'Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
Well, I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby we found love right where we are

And we found love right where we are
White lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Cool girl, no phone





And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly

And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
To fly
For angels to die
I'm not a rapper
I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit of spitting
Quicker lyrics you know
You found me ripping the writtens
Out of the pages they sit in
And never once I get bitten,
Because plagiarism is hidden
Which I would sit on the rhythm,
Prisoner with a vision

Signed to a label, but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio with a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's on to the next saga
We drink the best lager
I never tried to win you
Over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now, and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the cane like it was Get Carter

For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and
I choked
And we've been sleeping at the subway station, sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't want to relax
But would it hurt your reputation,
If I put it on wax?
I take it back now





[chorus]
Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Take it back with the rhythm and blues
And my back pack I'll be singing the news,
Trying to act like Jack Black when I bring him to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes,
I give you the truth through the vocal booth,
Stars burst out on the scene like an opal fruit,
They try and take aim like beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm, whispering everything that happens is from now on,
I'll be ready to start it again at the end of the song,
Still they claiming that I handled it wrong,
But then I never had an enemy, except for NME,
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as the magazines will ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees,
Are healthier than a dalmatian with pedigree
Singing for the masses,
Rubber dinghy rapids,
Keep this rapping a habit
And keep on fashioning magic,
I'm battling with respect,
I don't know if I'll have it,
This songs from the heart,
Covering the planet,
I'll take it back now

[chorus]
Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Take it back now
Now, I don't ever want to be perfect,
Cause I'm a singer that you
Never want to see shirtless
I accept the fact that someone's got to win the worst-dressed,
Taking my first steps into the scene,
Giving me focus
Putting on a brave face, like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change,
Thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings
Avoiding tradition
Cause every day some lyrics
And a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind-state, vividly,
I need to let my liver be
And I say it again,
Living life on the edge,
With a closed hand full of friends
Is good advice from a man
Who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
Might seem totally impossible
Achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist, giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely,
You'll find me in the back
Room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out;
It's time to take it back now

[chorus]
Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

Come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love, oh

My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, and lies, deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold woah
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage
Of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that posties
Little sister has to babysit, that's just a way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back

We are surrounded by all of these lights
And people who talk too much
You've got that kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need





I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea

And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, so in love

Lumiere, darling
Lumiere over me [x6]

And should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it's enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love, so in love
So in love, love, love, love,
So in love

You look so wonderful in your dress
I loved your hair like that
And in the moment I knew you best
Now I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me cause I write the truth
No I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But f- it, I won't be changing the subject I love it
I'll make your little secret public it's nothing
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot
I think not

[Hook]
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with





I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore

And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest

I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, \"Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions or other people's quotes\"

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment





The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fitten' in your jeans
It's love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can alle be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat
And away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree
But lord knows everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the star monkey crashing in their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

The club isn't the best place to find a lover,
So the bar is where I go,
Me and my friends at the table doing shots,
Drinking fast,

And trust me,
I'll give it a chance now,
Take my hand,

Put ""Van the Man"" on the jukebox,
And then we start to dance,

And how your family is doing okay,

I found a love for me,
Darling,
just dive right in and follow my lead,
Well,
I found a girl,
beautiful and sweet,
Oh,
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me,
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,
Not knowing what it was,
I will not give you up this time,
But darling,
just kiss me slow,
your heart is all I own,
And in your eyes you're holding mine Baby,
I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass,
listening to our favorite song,
When you said you looked a mess,
I whispered underneath my breath,
But you heard it,
darling,
you look perfect tonight Well I found a woman,
stronger than anyone I know,
She shares my dreams,
I hope that someday I'll share her home,
I found a love,
to carry more than just my secrets,
To carry love,
to carry children of our own,
We are still kids,
but we're so in love,
Fighting against all odds,
I know we'll be alright this time,
Darling,
just hold my hand,
Be my girl,
I'll be your man,
I see my future in your eyes Baby,
I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass,
listening to our favorite song,
When you saw you in that dress,
looking so beautiful,
I don't deserve this,
darling,
you look perfect tonight Baby,
I'm dancing in the dark,
with you between my arms,
Barefoot in the grass,
listening to our favorite song,
I have faith in what I see,
Now I know I have met an angel in person,
And she looks perfect,
no I don't deserve this,
You look perfect tonight"
Loving can hurt,
Loving can hurt sometimes,
But it's the only thing,
That I know. And when it gets hard,
You know it can get hard sometimes,
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive. We keep this love in a photograph,
We make these memories for ourselves,
Where our eyes are never closing,
Hearts are never broken,
And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me,
Inside the pocket,
Of your ripped jeans,
Holdin' me closer,
Till our eyes meet,
You won't ever be alone,
Wait for me to come home. Loving can heal,
Loving can mend your soul,
And is the only thing,
That I know (know),
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of ya,
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die. We keep this love in a photograph,
We make these memories for ourselves,
Where our eyes are never closing,
Our hearts were never broken,
And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me,
Inside the pocket,
Of your ripped jeans,
Holdin' me closer,
Till our eyes meet,
You won't ever be alone. And if you hurt me,
Well that's okay baby only words bleed,
Inside these pages you just hold me,
And I won't ever let you go. Wait for me to come home,
Wait for me to come home,
Wait for me to come home,
Wait for me to come home. Oh you can fit me,
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16,
Next to your heartbeat,
Where I should be,
Keep it deep within your soul. And if you hurt me,
Well that's okay baby only words bleed,
Inside these pages you just hold me,
And I won't ever let you go. When I'm away,
I will remember how you kissed me,
Under the lamppost,
Back on 6th street,
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
Wait for me to come home."
When your legs don't work like they used to before,
And I can't sweep you off of your feet,
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?,
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? And,
darling,
I will be loving you till we're 70,
And,
baby,
my heart could still fall as hard at 23,
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways,
Maybe just the touch of a hand,
Well,
me,
I fall in love with you every single day,
And I just wanna tell you I am So,
honey,
now,
Take me into your loving arms,
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars,
Place your head on my beating heart,
I'm thinking out loud,
Maybe we found love right where we are When my hair's all but gone,
and my memory fades,
And the crowds don't remember my name,
When my hands don't play the strings the same way,
I know you will still love me the same 'Cause,
honey,
your soul could never grow old,
it's evergreen,
And,
baby,
your smile's forever in my mind and memory,
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways,
And maybe it's all part of a plan,
Well,
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes,
Hoping that you'll understand That,
baby,
now,
Take me into your loving arms,
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars,
Place your head on my beating heart,
I'm thinking out loud,
And maybe we found love right where we are La la la,
la la la,
la la la,
la la la loud So,
baby,
now,
Take me into your loving arms,
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars,
Oh,
darling,
place your head on my beating heart,
I'm thinking out loud,
Then maybe we found love right where we are,
Oh,
baby,
we found love right where we are,
And we found love right where we are"
Walking down 29th and park,
I saw you in another's arms,
Only a month we've been apart,
You look happier Saw you walk inside a bar,
He said something to make you laugh,
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours,
Yeah,
you look happier,
you do Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you,
But ain't nobody love you like I do,
Promise that I will not take it personal,
baby,
If you're moving on with someone new 'Cause baby you look happier,
you do,
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too,
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth,
But I know I was happier with you Sat on the corner of the room,
Everything's reminding me of you,
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier,
Aren't you? Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you,
But ain't nobody need you like I do,
I know that there's others that deserve you,
But my darling,
I am still in love with you But I guess you look happier,
you do,
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too,
I could try to smile to hide the truth,
But I know I was happier with you Baby,
you look happier,
you do,
I know one day you'd fall for someone new,
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do,
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you"
White lips,
pale face,
Breathing in snowflakes,
Burnt lungs,
sour taste Light's gone,
day's end,
Struggling to pay rent,
Long nights,
strange men And they say,
She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since eighteen,
But lately,,
Her face seems,
Slowly sinking,
wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
The worst things in life come free to us 'Cause we're just under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple grams,
And she don't want to go outside tonight,
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
Or sells love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
Angels to fly Ripped gloves,
raincoat,
Tried to swim and stay afloat,
Dry house,
wet clothes,
Loose change,
bank notes,
Weary-eyed,
dry throat,
Call girl,
no phone And they say,
She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since eighteen,
But lately,,
Her face seems,
Slowly sinking,
wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
The worst things in life come free to us 'Cause we're just under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple grams,
And she don't want to go outside tonight,
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
Or sells love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly An angel will die,
Covered in white,
Closed eye,
And hoping for a better life,
This time will fade out tonight,
Straight down the line And they say,
She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since eighteen,
But lately,,
Her face seems,
Slowly sinking,
wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
They scream,
The worst things in life come free to us And we're all under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple grams,
And we don't want to go outside tonight,
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland,
Or sell love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
Angels to fly,
To fly,
fly,
For angels to fly,
to fly,
to fly,
For angels to die"
Oh,
misty eye of the mountain below,
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls,
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke,
Keep watching over Durin's sons If this is to end in fire,
Then we should all burn together,
Watch the flames climb high into the night Calling out father oh,
Stand by and we will,
Watch the flames burn on and on,
The mountain side And if we should die tonight,
Then we should all die together,
Raise a glass of wine for the last time Calling out father oh,
Prepare as we will,
Watch the flames burn on and on,
The mountain side,
Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire,
Inside the mountain,
I see fire,
Burning the trees,
And I see fire,
Hollowing souls,
I see fire,
Blood in the breeze,
And I hope that you remember me Oh,
should my people fall,
Then surely I'll do the same,
Confined in mountain halls,
We got too close to the flame Calling out father oh,
Hold fast and we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on,
The mountain side,
Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire,
Inside the mountain,
I see fire,
Burning the trees,
I see fire,
Hollowing souls,
I see fire,
Blood in the breeze,
And I hope that you remember me And if the night is burning,
I will cover my eyes,
For if the dark returns,
Then my brothers will die,
And as the sky is falling down,
It crashed into this lonely town,
And with that shadow upon the ground,
I hear my people screaming out Now I see fire,
Inside the mountains,
I see fire,
Burning the trees,
I see fire,
Hollowing souls,
I see fire,
Blood in the breeze,
I see fire (oh you know I saw a city burning out) (fire),
And I see fire (feel the heat upon my skin,
yeah) (fire),
And I see fire (fire),
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side"
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill,
I threw the day old tea from the cup,
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made,
Memories of a life that's been loved,
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals,
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink,
Dad always told me,
""Don't you cry when you're down"",
But mum,
there's a tear every time that I blink Oh I'm in pieces,
it's tearing me up,
but I know,
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved So I'll sing Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum,
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up,
Spread your wings as you go,
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah,
You're home Fluffed the pillows,
made the beds,
stacked the chairs up,
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case,
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek,
And wiped a tear from the side of my face I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know,
A life with love is a life that's been lived So I'll sing Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum,
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up,
Spread your wings as you go,
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah,
You're home Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum,
You got to see the person I have become,
Spread your wings and I know,
That when God took you back he said Hallelujah,
You're home"
When I was six years old,
I broke my leg,
I was running from my brother and his friends,
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,
I was younger then,
take me back to when I Found my heart and broke it here,
Made friends and lost them through the years,
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long,
I know I've grown,
but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes,
Running from the law through the backfields and,
Getting drunk with my friends,
Had my first kiss on a Friday night,
I don't reckon that I did it right,
but I was younger then,
take me back to when,
We found weekend jobs,
when we got paid,
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight,
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long,
Oh,
how we've grown,
but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill One friend left to sell clothes,
One works down by the coast,
One had two kids,
but lives alone,
One's brother overdosed,
One's already on his second wife,
One's just barely getting by,
but,
These people raised me,
And I can't wait to go home And I'm on my way,
I still remember these old country lanes,
When we did not know the answers,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill"
Give me love like her,
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone,
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,
Told you I'd let them go,
And that I'll fight my corner,
Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,
No,
I just wanna hold ya Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,
My,
my,

And it's been a while but I still feel the same,
Maybe I should let you go,
You know I'll fight my corner,
And that tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood is drowning in alcohol,
No I just wanna hold ya Give a little time to me or burn this out,
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around,
All I want is the taste that your lips allow,

I found a love,
For me,
Oh darling,
just dive right in,
And follow my lead,
Well,
I found a girl,
Beautiful and sweet,
Oh,
I never knew you were the someone,
Waitin' for me,
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,
Not knowin' what it was,
I will not give you up this time,
But darling,
just kiss me slow,
Your heart is all I own,
And in your eyes,
you're holding mine Baby,
I'm dancing in the dark,
With you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass,
Listening to our favourite song,
When you said you looked a mess,
I whispered underneath my breath,
But you heard it,
Darling,
you look perfect tonight Well,
I found a man,
Stronger than anyone I know,
He shares my dreams,
I hope that someday we'll share a home,
I found a love,
To carry more than just my secrets,
To carry love,
to carry children,
Of our own,
We are still kids,
but we're so in love,
Fightin' against all odds,
I know we'll be alright this time,
Darling,
just hold my hand,
Be your girl,
you'll be my man,
And I see my future in your eyes Well baby,
I'm dancing in the dark,
With you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass,
While listening to our favorite song,
When I saw you in that dress,
Looking so beautiful,
I don't deserve this,
Darling,
you look perfect tonight [Instrumental] Baby,
I'm dancing in the dark,
With you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass,
While listenin' to our favorite song,
I have faith in what I see,
Now I know I have met an angel,
In person,
And she looks perfect,
And he looks perfect,
No I don't deserve this,
You look perfect tonight"
La,
la,
la,
la I met this girl late last year,
She said don't you worry if I disappear,
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake,
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned,
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn,
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again,
She told me I was never looking for a friend,
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,
Baby,
bring the lemon & a bottle of gin,
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM,
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said,
She's singing...,
la,
la,
la,
la,
Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that,
babe la,
la,
la Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe la,
la,
la For a couple of weeks I only want to see her,
We drink away the days with a take away pizza,
Before a text message was the only way to reach her,
Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha,
all over the track like a feature,
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either,
But me & her we make money the same way,
Four cities,
two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about,
Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out,
I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch,
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down,
the way that things played out,
When she was kissing him how I was confused about,
She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that,
babe,
Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe On my hotel door!,
I don't even know if she knows what for,
She was crying on my shoulder,
I already told you,
Trust & respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next,
But you didn't need to take him to bed,
that's all,
And I never saw him as a threat,
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour,
We were staying on the same hotel floor,
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
But it was never just fun & I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted,
It's a bit too much,
too late if I'm honest,
And all this time God knows I'm singing Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that,
babe,
Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe"
It's just another night,
And I'm staring at the moon,
I saw a shooting star,
And thought of you,
I sang a lullaby,
By the waterside and knew,
If you were here,
I'd sing to you You're on the other side,
As the skyline splits in two,
I'm miles away from seeing you I can see the stars,
From America?,
I wonder,
do you see them,
too? So open your eyes and see,
The way our horizons meet,
And all of the lights will lead,
Into the night with me,
And I know these scars will bleed,
But both of our hearts believe,
All of these stars will guide us home I can hear your heart,
On the radio beat,
They're playing 'Chasing Cars',
And I thought of us,
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me,
I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand,
Back through lamplit streets and knew,
Everything led back to you So can you see the stars,
Over Amsterdam?,
You're the song my heart is beating to So open your eyes and see,
The way our horizons meet,
And all of the lights will lead,
Into the night with me,
And I know these scars will bleed,
But both of our hearts believe,
All of these stars will guide us home And oh,
And oh,
And oh I can see the stars,
From America"
I found a love for me,
Oh darling,
just dive right in and follow my lead,
Well,
I found a girl,
beautiful and sweet,
Oh,
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me 'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love,
Not knowing what it was,
I will not give you up this time,
But darling,
just kiss me slow,
your heart is all I own,
And in your eyes,
you're holding mine Baby,
I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms,
Barefoot on the grass,
listening to our favourite song,
When you said you looked a mess,
I whispered underneath my breath,
But you heard it,
darling,
you look perfect tonight Sei la mia donna,
la forza delle onde del mare,
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti e molto di piu,
Spero che un giorno,
l'amore che ci ha accompagnato,
Diventi casa,
la mia famiglia,
diventi noi E siamo sempre bambini ma nulla e impossibile,
Stavolta non ti lascero,
Mi baci piano ed io torno ad esistere,
E nel tuo sguardo crescero Ballo con te,
nell'oscurita,
stretti forte poi,
A piedi nudi noi,
dentro la nostra musica,
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto:,
""Tu stasera,
vedi,
sei perfetta per me"" Ballo con te,
nell'oscurita,
stretti forte poi,
A piedi nudi noi,
dentro la nostra musica,
Ho creduto sempre in noi,
Perche sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato Quanto ti ho aspettato,
Perche tu stasera sei perfetta per me"
Settle down with me,
Cover me up,
Cuddle me in Lie down with me,
yeah,
And hold me in your arms And your heart's against my chest,
Your lips pressed to my neck,
I'm falling for your eyes,
But they don't know me yet And with a feeling I'll forget,
I'm in love now Kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love Settle down with me,
And I'll be your safety,
You'll be my lady I was made to keep your body warm,
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms My heart's against your chest,
Your lips pressed to my neck,
I'm falling for your eyes,
But they don't know me yet And with this feeling I'll forget,,
I'm in love now Kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love Yeah I've been feeling everything,
From hate to love,
From love to lust,
From lust to truth,
I guess that's how I know you,
So I hold you close to help you give it up So kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love Kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love"
Oh,
maybe I came on too strong,
Maybe I waited too long,
Maybe I played my cards wrong,
Oh,
just a little bit wrong,
Baby I apologize for it I could fall or I could fly,
Here in your aeroplane,
And I could live,
I could die,
Hanging on the words you say,
And I've been known to give my all,
And jumping in harder than,
Ten thousand rocks on the lake So don't call me baby,
Unless you mean it,
Don't tell me you need me,
If you don't believe it,
So let me know the truth,
Before I dive right into you You're a mystery,
I have traveled the world,
there's no other girl like you,
No one,
what's your history?,
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?,
'Cause I heard you do,
mmh I could fall or I could fly,
Here in your aeroplane,
And I could live,
I could die,
Hanging on the words you say,
And I've been known to give my all,
And lie awake,
every day,
Don't know how much I can take So don't call me baby,
Unless you mean it,
Don't tell me you need me,
If you don't believe it,
So let me know the truth,
Before I dive right into you I could fall or I could fly,
Here in your aeroplane,
And I could live,
I could die,
Hanging on the words you say,
And I've been known to give my all,
Sitting back,
looking at,
Every mess that I made So don't call me baby,
Unless you mean it,
Don't tell me you need me,
If you don't believe it,
So let me know the truth,
Before I dive right into you,
Before I dive right into you,
Before I dive right into you"
Now I'm in town,
break it down,
thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd,
That's you now,
ciao,
seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus,
as I sing to you loud And I can't,
no,
I won't hush,
I say the words that make you blush,
I'm gonna sing this now See,
I'm true,
my songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue,
I stick to other artists,
I'm not you,
now that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures See,
I'm real,
I do it all,
it's all me,
I'm not fake,
don't ever call me lazy,
I won't stay put,
give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me 'Cause you need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse,
Hell,
don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell,
Call yourself a singer-writer,
you're just bluffing,
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing I sing fast,
I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School,
I came fast with the way I act,
right,
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe And I won't be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating,
When I perform live,
feels like I am meditating,
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me,
'Young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi' 'Cause you need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me 'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right,
I won't stop till my name's in lights,
At stadium heights with Damien Rice,
On red carpets,
now I'm on Arabian Nights,
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice Long nighter,
short height and I going hyper,
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter,
yeah,
The game's over but now I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows,
But I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch,
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out From day one,
I've been prepared,
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair,
So now I'm back to the sofa,
giving a dose of what the future holds,
'Cause it's another day Plus I'll keep my last name forever,
keep this genre pretty basic,
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it,
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers,
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for majors,
Nationwide tour with Just Jack,
still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache I hit back when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago,
But more people hear me though,
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos I'm always doing shows,
if I'm not,
I'm in the studio,
Truly broke,
never growing up,
call me Rufio,
Melody music maker,
Reading all the papers,
They say I'm up.and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator 'Cause you need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you"
I'm gonna pick up the pieces,
And build a Lego house,
If things go wrong we can knock it down My three words have two meanings,
There's one thing on my mind,
It's all for you And it's dark in a cold December,,
But I've got you to keep me warm,
If you're broken I will mend you,
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of sight,
I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now,
now I'm gonna paint you by numbers,
And color you in,
If things go right we can frame it,
And put you on a wall And it's so hard to say it,
But I've been here before,
Now I'll surrender up my heart,
And swap it for yours I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of sight,
I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now Don't hold me down,
I think the braces are breaking,,
And it's more than I can take And it's dark in a cold December,,
But I've got you to keep me warm,
If you're broken I will mend you,
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of sight,
I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I will love you better now"
You look so wonderful in your dress,
I love your hair like that,
The way it falls on the side of your neck,
Down your shoulders and back,
We are surrounded by all of these lies and people that talk too much,
You got the kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us Should this be the last thing I see,
I want you to know it's enough for me,
'cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need So in love,
So in love,
So in love,
So in love You look so beautiful in this light,
You silhouette over me,
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the Tenerife Sea,
And all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath,
Just say the word and I will disappear into the wilderness,
Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me,
'cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need,
So in love So in love,
So in love,
So in love,
Lumiere,
darling Lumiere over me,
Lumiere,
darling,
Lumiere over me,
Lumiere,
darling,
Lumiere over me,
Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me,
'cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need,
So in love,
So in love,
So in love (love,
love,
love),
So in love,
You looked so wonderful in your dress,
I loved your hair like that,
And in the moment I knew you Beth"
You are the one,
girl,
And you know that it's true,
I'm feeling younger,
Every time that I'm alone with you We were sitting in a parked car,
Stealing kisses in a front yard,
We got questions we should not ask,
but How would you feel,
If I told you I loved you,
It's just something that I want to do,
I'll be taking my time,
Spending my life,
Falling deeper in love with you,
So tell me that you love me too In the summer,
As the lilacs bloom,
Blood flows deeper than a river,
Every moment that I spend with you We were sat upon our best friend's roof,
I had both of my arms around you,
Watching the sunrise replace the moon,
but How would you feel,
If I told you I loved you,
It's just something that I want to do,
I'll be taking my time,
Spending my life,
Falling deeper in love with you,
So tell me that you love me too Yeah,
we were sitting in a parked car,
Stealing kisses in a front yard,
We got questions we should not ask How would you feel,
If I told you I loved you,
It's just something that I want to do,
I'll be taking my time,
Spending my life,
Falling deeper in love with you,
Tell me that you love me too,
Tell me that you love me too,
Tell me that you love me too"
She played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said,
""Baby,
I just want to dance"" I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar,
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar,
She asked me what does it mean,
the Gaelic ink on your arm?,
Said it was one of my friend's songs,
do you want to drink on?,
She took Jamie as a chaser,
Jack for the fun,
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun,
Chatted some more,
one more drink at the bar,
Then put Van on the jukebox,
got up to dance You know,
she played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said,
""Baby,
I just want to dance"",
With my pretty little Galway Girl,
You're my pretty little Galway Girl You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool,
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room,
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool,
After dancing to Ceilidh singing to trad tunes,
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet,
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat,
Oh,
I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week,
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me You know,
she played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,

I was holding her hand,
her hand was holding mine,
Our coats both smell of smoke,
whisky and wine,
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night,
I walked her home then she took me inside,
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine,
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write,
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night She played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said,

When the sins of my father,
Weigh down in my soul,
And the pain of my mother,
Will not let me go Well I know there can come fire from the sky,
To refine the purest of kings,
And even though,
I know this fire brings me pain,
Even so,
And just the same Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Oh,
make it rain,
Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Make it rain Oh,
the seed needs the water,
Before it grows out of the ground,
But it just keeps on getting hotter,
And the hunger more profound Well I know there can come tears from the eye,
But they may as well all be in vain,
And even though,
I know these tears come with pain,
Even so,
And just the same Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Oh,
make it rain,
Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Just make it rain,
Make it rain Oh,
the seas are full of water,
That stops by the shore,
Just like the riches of grandeur,
Oh,
no no,
Never reach the poor And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause,
And let lightning be the veins,
And fill the sky,
with all that they can draw,
When it's time to make a change Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Make it rain,

Oh,

Oh,

Make it rain,
Make it rain,
Oh,
make it rain"
It's late in the evening,
Glass on the side,
I've been sat with you,
For most of the night,
Ignoring everybody here,
We wish they would disappear,
So maybe we could get down now And I don't wanna know,
If you're getting ahead of the programme,
I want you to be mine,
lady,
And to hold your body close,
Take another step into the no-man's land,
For the longest time,
lady I need you,
darling,
Come on,
set the tone,
If you feel you're falling,
Won't you let me know?,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh If you love me,
Come on,
get involved,
Feel it rushing through you,
From your head to toe,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh Sing!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Louder!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Sing!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh This love is ablaze,
I saw flames from the side of the stage,
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days,
Until then,
we got nothing to say,
And nothing to know,
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke Let it go until our roads are changed,
Singing ""we found love in a local rave"",
no,
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say,
But I can just figure it out and then hope and pray I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya"",
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila,
I already know she's a keeper,
Just from this one small act of kindness,
I'm in deep if anybody finds out,
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now,
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch,
One thing led to another,
Now she's kissing my mouth I need you,
darling,
Come on,
set the tone,
If you feel you're falling,
Won't you let me know?,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,
If you love me,
Come on,
get involved,
Feel it rushing through you,
From your head to toe,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh Sing!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Louder!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Sing!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh Can you feel it?,
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance,
Can you feel it?,
All that I can hear is music from the back,
Can you feel it?,
I found you hiding here so won't you take my hand,
darling?,
Before the beat kicks in again Can you feel it?,
Can you feel it? Sing!,
I need you,
darling,
Come on set the tone,
If you feel you're falling,
Won't you let me know?,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
(Louder!),
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
(Sing!),
If you love me,
Come on,
get involved,
Feel it rushing through you,
From your head to toe,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
(Louder!),
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh Sing!"
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow,
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know,
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in,
I never want to get bitten,
Cause plagiarism is hidden,
Watch how I sit on the rhythm,
Prisoner with a vision,
Signed to a label,
But didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't,
So perk your ears up and listen,
Studio is the system,
And you could say that I'm driven,
And now it's onto the next saga,
We drink the best lager,
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather,
I do my own thing now,
And get respect after,
And I'm avoiding the 'caine,
Like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay,
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded,
Like a paper weight,
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home,
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked,
Went from sleeping at a subway station,
To sleeping with a movie star,
And adding to the population,
Not my imagination,
I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back love No I take it back with the rhythm and blues,
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news,
Tryin' act like Jack Black,
When I bring it to school,
I make a beat with my feet,
By just hittin' the loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove,
That I can fit in these shoes,
I give you the truth through the vocal booth,
And stars burst out on the scene,
Like an opal fruit,
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm,
Whispering everything that happens,
Is from now on I'll be ready to start again By the end of the song,
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong,
But then I've never had an enemy,
Except the NME but I'll be selling,
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me,
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree,
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids,
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic,
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it This song's from the heart cover the planet,
I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love,
No,
And take it back now Now I don't ever wanna be perfect,
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless,
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed,
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus,
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton,
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless,
Rhyming over recordings,
avoiding tradition,
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written,
Now absence can make your heart ache,
But drinking absinth can change your mind state,
Vividly need to let my liver be,
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends,
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me,
And I hope to see him blowing up globally,
'Cause that how it's supposed to be,
I'm screaming out vocally,
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams,
But,
but I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be,
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down,
that's how we plan it out,
It's time to take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back love,
No Mmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back love,
No"
We're not,
No we're not friends,
Nor have we ever been,
We just try to keep those secrets in a lie,
And if they find out,
will it all go wrong,
And heaven knows no one wants it to,
So I could take the back road,
But your eyes will lead me straight back home,
And if you know me like I know you,
You should love me,
you should know,
Friends just sleep in another bed,
And friends don't treat me like you do,
Well I know that there's a limit to everything,
But my friends won't love me like you,
No,
my friends won't love me like you We're not friends,
We could be anything,
If we try to keep those secrets safe,
No one will find out,
If it all went wrong,
They'll never know what we've been through,
So I could take the back road,
But your eyes will lead me straight back home,
And if you know me like I know you,
You should love me,
you should know,
That friends just sleep in another bed,
And friends don't treat me like you do,
Well I know that there's a limit to everything,
But my friends won't love me like you No,
my friends won't love me like you But then again,
if we're not friends,
Someone else might love you too And then again,
if we're not friends,
There'd be nothing I could do And that's why friends should sleep in other beds,
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do,
And I know that there's a limit to everything,
But my friends won't love me like you,
No,
my friends won't love me like you,
Oh my friends will never love me like you"
Tell me that you'd turn down the man,
Who askes for your hand,
'Cause you're waiting for me,
And I know,
You're gonna be away a while,
But I've got no plans at all to leave Would you take away my hopes and dreams,
And just stay with me? All my senses come to life,
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I,
Have ever been and I'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one,
And all my friends have gone to find,
Another place to let their hearts collide,
Just promise me,
you'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one Take my hand and my,
Heart and soul,
I will,
Only have these eyes for you,
And you know,,
Everything changes but,
We'll be strangers if we see this through We could stay within these walls and bleed,
Or just stay with me? All my senses come to life,
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I,
Have ever been and I'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one,
And all my friends have gone to find,
Another place to let their hearts collide,
Just promise me,
you'll always be a friend,
'Cause you are the only one Stumbling half drunk,
Getting myself lost,
I am so gone,
So tell me the way home,
I listen to sad songs,
Singing about love,
And where it goes wrong All my senses come to life,
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I,
Have ever been and I'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one,
And all my friends have gone to find,
Another place to let their hearts collide,
Just promise me,
you'll always be a friend,
'Cause you are the only one"
Things were all good yesterday,
And then the devil took your memory,
And if you fell to your death today,
I hope that heaven is your resting place,
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain,
But then that could have been the medicine,
And now you're lying in the bed again,
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them My father told me,
son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
You're not the only one,
Although my grandma used to say,
He used to sing Darlin' hold me in your arms,
The way you did last night,
And we'll die inside,
For a little while here oh I could look into your eyes,
Until the sun comes up,
And we're wrapped in light and life and love,
Put your open lips on mine,
And slowly let them shut,
For they're designed to be together oh,
With your body next to mine,
Our hearts will beat as one,
And we set alight,
We're afire love Love,
love Things were all good yesterday,
Then the devil took your breath away,
Now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit black tie standing in the rain,
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend,
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen,
Six years old I remember when My father told me,
son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
You're not the only one,
Although my grandma used to say,
He used to sing Darlin' hold me in your arms,
The way you did last night,
And we'll die inside,
For a little while here oh I could look into your eyes,
Until the sun comes up,
And we're wrapped in light and life and love,
Put your open lips on mine,
And slowly let them shut,
For they're designed to be together oh,
With your body next to mine,
Our hearts will beat as one,
And we're set alight,
We're afire love Love,
love See the love,
the love,
the love,

See the love,

See the love,

Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah,
And my mother and all of my family,
Rise from their seats to say hallelujah,
And my brother and all of my family,
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah,
(To my brother and my sister,
yeah,
ah),
My father and all of my family,
Rise from their seats to sing,
Hallelujah To the love,

You're just a small bump unborn,
In four months you're brought to life,
Might be left with my hair,
But you'll have your mother's eyes I'll hold your body in my hands,
Be as gentle as I can,
But for now you're a scan on my unmade plans,
A small bump,
in four months you're brought to life And I'll whisper quietly,
And give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me,
I'll put my future in you You are my one,
and only,
And you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
You are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
And you'll be alright You're just a small bump,
I know you'll grow into your skin,
With a smile like hers,
And a dimple beneath the chin Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice,
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide,
A small bump,
in four months you'll open your eyes And I'll hold you tightly,
And tell you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me,
I'll put my future in you You are my one,
and only,
And you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
Oh you are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
And you'll be alright Then you can lie with me,
with your tiny feet,
When you're half asleep,
I'll leave you be,
Right in front of me for a couple weeks,
So I can keep you safe 'Cause you are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
Oh you are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
And you'll be alright Cause you were just a small bump unborn,
for four months then torn from life,
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why"
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon,
But God gave me a stage,
a guitar and a song,
My daddy told me: ""Son,
don't you get involved in,
Politics,
religions or other people's quarrels"" I'll paint the picture,
let me set the scene,
I know when I have children,
they will know what it means,
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me,
Just love and understanding,
positivity We could change this whole world with a piano,
Add a bass,
some guitar,
grab a beat and away we go,
I'm just a boy with a one-man show,
No university,
no degree,
but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth,
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios,
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote,
Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"" Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment The revolution's coming,
it's a minute away,
I saw people marching in the streets today,
You know we are made up of love and hate,
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade I'll paint the picture,
let me set the scene,
I know,
I'm all for people following their dreams,
Just remember life is more than fitting in your jeans,
It's love and understanding,
positivity We could change this whole world with a piano,
Add a bass,
some guitar,
grab a beat and away we go,
I'm just a boy with a one-man show,
No university,
no degree,
but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth,
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios,
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote,
Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"" Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment I'll paint the picture,
let me set the scene,
You know the future's in the hands of you and me,
So let's all get together,
we can all be free,
Spread love and understanding,
positivity We could change this whole world with a piano,
Add a bass,
some guitar,
grab a beat and away we go,
I'm just a boy with a one-man show,
No university,
no degree,
but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth,
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios,
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote,
Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"" Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"
She is the sweetest thing that I know,
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low,
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time,
Took my heart upon a one way trip,
Guess she went wandering off with it,
None like most women I know,
This one will bring it back whole,
Daisies,
daisies perched upon your forehead,
Oh my baby,
lately I know That every night I'll kiss you,
you'll say in my ear,
Oh we're in love,
aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs,
baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
Yeah-yeah,
yeah-yeah She is the river flowin' nowhere,
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells,
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs,
Spend my summertime beside her,
And the rest of the year the same,
She is the flint that sparks the lighter,
And the fuel that will hold the flame,
oh,
Roses,
roses laid upon your bed spread,
oh my,
All this,
all this I know But every night I'll kiss you,
you'll say in my ear,
Oh we're in love,
aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs,
baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
Yeah-yeah,
yeah-yeah Well,
I've found love inside,
The arms of the woman I know,
She is the lighthouse in the night,
That will safely guide me home,
And I'm not scared of passing over,
Or the thought growing old,
'Cause from now until I go Every night I kiss you,
you'll say in my ear,
Oh we're in love,
aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs,
baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
Every night I kiss you,
you'll say in my ear,
Oh we're in love,
aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs,
baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah"
I should ink my skin,
With your name,
And take my passport out again,
And just replace it See I could do without a tan on my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle,
And I should run you a hot bath,
And fill it up with bubbles 'Cause maybe you're loveable,
Maybe you're my snowflake,
And your eyes turn from green to gray,
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place,
And you should never cut your hair,
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder And you will never know,
Just how beautiful you are to me,
But maybe I'm just in love,
When you wake me up And would you ever feel guilty,
If you did the same to me?,
Could you make me a cup of tea,
To open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek,
Because we've watched it 12 times,
But maybe you're hoping,
For a fairytale too And if your DVD breaks today,
You should've got a VCR,
Because I've never owned a Blue-Ray,,
True say And now I've always been shit at computer games,
Because your brother always beats me,
And if I lost,
I'd go across,
And chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me,
And be asking me,
If I'm gonna be home next week,
And then you lie with me,
Till I fall asleep,
And flutter eyelash on my cheek,
Between the sheets And you will never know,
Just how beautiful you are to me,
But maybe I'm just in love,
When you wake me up And I think you hate the smell of smoke,
You always try and get me to stop,
You drink as much as me,
And I get drunk a lot So I take you to the beach,
And walk along the sand,
And I'll make you a heart pendant,
With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace,
So the heart falls where your chest is,
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach,
And it falls just where it needs to be,
And rests peacefully,
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now,
Against yours now 'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"
I've been spinning now for time,
Couple women by my side I got sinning on my mind,
Sipping on red wine,
I've been sitting here for ages,
Ripping out the pages,
How'd I get so faded,
How'd I get so faded?,
Oh no no,
don't leave me lonely now,
If you loved me how'd you never learn Ooh,
coloured crimson in my eyes,
One or two could free my mind,
This is how it ends,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream Fading out again,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream,
So tell me when it kicks in,
Hmmmm,
hmmmm,
hmmmm,
Well tell me when it kicks in Hmmmm,
hmmmm,
hmmmm,
I've been looking for a lover,
Thought I'd find her in a bottle God,
make me another one,
I'll be feeling this tomorrow,
Lord,
forgive me for the things I've done,
I was never meant to hurt no one,
And I saw scars upon a brokenhearted lover,
Oh no no,
don't leave me lonely now,
If you loved me how'd you never learn Ooh,
coloured crimson in my eyes,
One or two could free my mind,
This is how it ends,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream Fading out again,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream,
So tell me when it kicks in,
Hmmmm,
hmmmm,
hmmmm,
Well tell me when it kicks in Hmmmm,
hmmmm,
hmmmm,
Tell me when it kicks in,
All the voices in my mind,
calling out across the line,
All the voices in my mind,
calling out across the line All the voices in my mind,
calling out across the line,
All the voices in my mind,
calling out across the line,
All the voices in my mind,
calling out across the line,
All the voices in my mind,
calling out across the line,
Tell me when it kicks in,
And I saw scars upon her Tell me when it kicks in,
Brokenhearted,
Tell me when it kicks in,
And I saw scars upon her,
Tell me when it kicks in,
Brokenhearted,
Tell me when it kicks in,
And I saw scars upon her,
Tell me when it kicks in,
Brokenhearted,
Tell me when it kicks in,
And I saw scars upon her,
Tell me when it kicks in,
Brokenhearted,
So tell me when it kicks in,
And I saw scars upon her,
Tell me when it kicks in,
Brokenhearted,
Tell me when it kicks in,
And I saw scars upon her,
Tell me when it kicks in,
Brokenhearted"
I found your hair band on my bedroom floor,
The only evidence that you've been here before,
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore,
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes Never getting dry,
so I get high,
Smoke away the days,
never sleep with the light on,
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye,
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night,
I don't drink like everybody else,
I do it to forget things about myself,
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got,
My mind's with you but my heart's just not So am I close to you anymore,
if it's over?,
And there's no chance that we'll work it out That's why you and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,
You and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied Everybody said we'd be together forever,
But I know that I never wanna settle down,,
Come around,
break up the love like lego now,
Never wanna turn into another like you,
Sleep with my thoughts,
dance with my views Everything's great,
not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus,
Now I'm in position to be another stalker,
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward Like our last kiss,
it was perfect,
But we were nervous,
on the surface,
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevent if it still hurts,
I forget like an elephant,
or we can use a sedative,
And go back to the day we fell in love just on first kiss So am I close to you anymore,
if it's over?,
And there's no chance that we'll work it out Oh you and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,
You and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied Because,
if I was gonna go somewhere,
I'd be there by now,
And maybe I can let myself down,
And I'm thinking I'm unaware,
I keep my feet on the ground,
And keep looking around,,
To make sure I'm not,
The only one to feel low Because if you want,
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered,
From all that I've done wrong,
And I know you'll say,
That I'm the only one,
But I know God made another one of me,
To love you better than I ever will 'Cause you and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one who knows that I lied,
You and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one who knows that I lied"
Will get up,
up on the dancefloor tonight,
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine,
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline,
Are in my blood,
both hands up on her waistline,
Get on up,
baby,
dance to the rhythm of the music,
Don't care what the DJ chooses,
Get lost in the rhythm with me,
Please don't close until we wanna leave it And you and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight,
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright,
Just close your eyes,
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street,
In Barcelona,
Barcelona,
Barcelona,
Barcelona Will get up,
up on the dancefloor,
move,
it's a Saturday night,
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight,
Reflected in your beautiful eyes,
I guess that is destiny doing it right,
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean,
Spin you around me again and again,
and You're like something that God has sent me,
I want you,
baby,
solamente And you and I we're flying on an aeroplane tonight,
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright,
Just close your eyes,
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street,
In Barcelona,
Barcelona,
Barcelona,
Barcelona,
Barcelona,
Barcelona Oh,
Barcelona,
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street,
In Barcelona Las ramblas,
I'll meet you,
We'll dance around la Sagrada Familia,
(Barcelona),
Drinking sangria,
Mi nina,
te amo mi carino,
(Barcelona),
Mamasita rica,
Si,
te adoro,
senorita,
(Barcelona),
Los otros,
viva la vida,
Come on,
let's be free in Barcelona,
Las ramblas,
I'll meet you,
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona,
Drinking Sangria,
I just want to be in Barcelona,
Mamasita,
rica,
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona,
Nosotros,
viva la vida,
Siempre vida,
Barcelona"
I met you when I was a teen,
But then you were one as well,
And I could play a guitar,
Just like ringing a bell,
Sometimes I wonder,,
In any other summer,
Could you be a part time lover to me,
Listening to Stevie Wonder?,
Under the covers where we used to lay,
And re stacks is what the speakers played,
I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a dvd,
smoking illegal weed,
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breath,
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see,
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep,
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us,
And I'd say you were beautiful without your make up,
And you don't need even to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that god made us,
And time's the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I was away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake So say it again Oh Nina,
you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina,
But then again you should know Nina Cause that's you and me both Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie,
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold,
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own,
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching blue planet,
creating new habits,
Acting as if we was two rabbits,
And then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics,
I'd disappear,
you'd call me selfish,
I understand but I can't help I put my job over everything except my family and friends,
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back,
Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break,
Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late,
So we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane,
But in a day we'd have to say it again Oh Nina,
you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina,
But then again you should know Nina,
Cause that's you and me both Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? Love will come and love will go,
But you can't make it on your own Sing that song,
Go oh won't you leave me now?,
People grow and fall apart,
But you can't mend your broken heart,
Take it back,
Go oh won't you leave me now?,
Ooh Oh Nina,
you should go Nina,
(Love will come and love will go,
but you can't make it on your own),
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
(Sing that song),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
And I've been living on the road Nina,
oh (People grow and fall apart),
But then again you should know Nina,
(But you can't mend your broken heart),
Cause that's you and me both Nina,
(Take it back),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
Now? Oh Nina,
you should go Nina,
(Love will come and love will go,
but you can't make it on your own),
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
(Sing that song),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
And I've been living on the road Nina (I've been living on the road),
(People grow and fall apart),
But then again you should know Nina (then again you should know),
(But you can't mend your broken heart),
Cause that's you and me both Nina (cause that's you and me both),
(Take it back),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
Now?"
He rode through the streets of the city,
Down from his hill on high,
O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles,
He rode to a woman's side,
For she was his secret treasure,
She was his shame and his bliss,
And a chain and a keep are nothing,
Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm. And there he stood with sword in hand,
The last of Derry's ten,
And red the grass beneath his feet,
And red his banners bright,
And red the blow of the setting sun,
That bathed him in its light,
C'mon c'mon the great lord called,
My sword is hungry still. And with the cry of savage rage,
They swarmed across the rill,
And with the cry of savage rage,
They swarmed across the rill. He rode through the streets of the city,,
Down from his hill on high,,
O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles,
He rode to a woman's side,,
For she was his secret treasure,
She was his shame and his bliss,
And a chain and a keep are nothing,
Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm"
I wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me,,
It never made me stronger at all Love will scar your makeup,,
Lip sticks to me,
So now I maybe lean back there,
I'm sat here,,
Wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to But a house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold I'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat in,
Cause you take parts of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?',
Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
To feel a little love I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I've got no plans for the weekend,
So should we speak then?,
Keep it between friends?,
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to There may be other people like us,
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up,
Flames just create us,
Burns don't heal like before,
And you don't hold me anymore On cold days cold plays out like the band's name,
I know I can't heal things with a handshake,
You know I can change,,
As I began saying,
You cut me wide open like landscape,
Open bottles of beer but never champagne,
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make,
Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
To feel a little love All by myself,
I'm here again,
All by myself,
You know I'll never change,
All by myself,
All by myself I'm just drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
To feel a little love"
Now I don't wanna hate you,
Just wish you'd never gone for the man,
And waited two weeks at least,
Before you let him take you,
I stayed true,
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school,
He's waiting for the time to move,
I knew he had his eyes on you,
He's not the right guy for you,
Don't hate me cause I write the truth,
No,
I would never lie to you,
But it was never fine to lose you,
And what a way to find out!,
It never came from my mouth,
You never changed your mind,
But you were just afraid to find out,
But fuck it,
I won't be changing the subject,
I love it,
I'll make your little secret public,
it's nothing,
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet,
To get back at me,
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep,
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually,
You're practically my family,
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be,
But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot?,
I think not I don't love you baby I don't need you baby,
I don't want you no,
Anymore I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't wanna love you no,
Anymore Recently I tend to zone out,
Up in my headphones to Holocene,
You promised your body but I'm away so much,
I stay more celibate than in a monastery,
I'm not cut out for life on the road,
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much,
And at the time we'd just go,
So sue me,
I guess I'm not the man that you need,
Ever since you went to UNI,
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack,
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad,
But when I broke the industry,
That's when I broke your heart,
I was supposed to chart and celebrate,
But good things are over fast,
I know it's hard to deal with and see this,
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features,
Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces,
Jesus,
I never really want to believe this,
Got advice from my dad,
And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it,
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with I don't love you baby I don't need you baby,
I don't want you no,
Anymore I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't wanna love you no,
Anymore And since you left,
I've given up my days off,
It's what I need to stay strong,
I know you have a day job,
But mine is 24/7,
I fell like writing a book,
I guess I lied in the hook cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could,
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist,
In 6 years yeah,
you'd probably be my wife with a kid,
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink,
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's,
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill,
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27,
I'll die from a thrill,
Go down in history as just a wasted talent,
Can I face the challenge,
Or did I make a mistake erasing? It's only therapy,
My thoughts just get ahead of me,
Eventually I'll be fine,
I know that it was never meant to be,
Either way I guess I'm not prepared But I'll say this,
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit,
Take my apology,
I'm sorry for the honesty,
But I had to get this off my chest I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't want you no,
Anymore I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't wanna love you no,
Anymore"
Of all the money that e'er I had,
I've spent it in good company,
And all the harm that e'er I've done,
alas,
it was to none but me,
And all I've done for want of wit,
to memory now I can't recall,
So fill to me the parting glass,
good night and joy be with you all Of all the comrades that e'er I had,
they are sorry for my going away,
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had,
they would wish me one more day to stay,
But since it falls unto my lord that I should rise and you should not,
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call Good night and joy be with you all,
A man may drink and not be drunk,
a man may fight and not be slain,
A man may court a pretty girl and perhaps be welcomed back again But since it has so ordered been by a time to rise and a time to fall,
Come fill to me the parting glass,
good night and joy be with you all,
Come fill to me the parting glass,
good night and joy be with you all"
Oh,
I'm a mess right now,
Inside out,
Searching for a sweet surrender,
But this is not the end I can't work it out,
How going through the motions,
Going through us And oh I've known it for the longest time,
And all of my hopes,
All of my own words,
Are all over written on the signs,
But you're on my road,
Walking me home,
home,
home,
home,
home See the flames inside my eyes,
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love,
no,
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar,
But for tonight I wanna fall in love,
And put your faith in my stomach I messed up this time,
Late last night,
Drinking to suppress devotion,
With fingers intertwined I can't shake this feeling now,
We're going through the motions,
Hoping you'd stop And oh I've only caused you pain,
I know but all of my words will always below,
Of all the love you spoke,
When you're on my road,
Walking me home,
home,
home,
home,
home See the flames inside my eyes,
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love,
no,
Easy,
baby,
maybe I'm a liar,
But for tonight I wanna fall in love,
And put your faith in my stomach And for how long I love my lover,
For how long I love my lover and now,
now,
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(And I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long I love my lover now,
now,
For how long,
long I love my lover"
I fell in love next to you,
Burning fires in this room,
It just fits,
Light and smooth,
Like my feet in my shoes,
Little one,
lie with me,
Sew you heart to my sleeve,
We'll stay quiet,
Underneath shooting stars,
If it helps you sleep,
And hold me tight,
Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe There's a firefly,
Loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down,
And I lie,
If I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better Through your eyes There's a firefly,
Loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down,
And I lie,
If I don't feel so right But the world looks better,
Through your eyes Teach my skin,
Those new tricks,
Warm me up,
With your lips,
Heart to heart,
Melt me down,
It's too cold,
In this town,
Close your eyes,
Lean on me,
Face to mouth,
Lips to cheek,
Feeling numb,
In my feet You're the one,
To help me get to sleep,
And hold me tight Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe,
There's a firefly Loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down And I lie,
If I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better,
Through your eyes,
There's a firefly Loose tonight,
Better catch it Before it burns this place down,
And I lie,
If I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better,
Through your eyes,
It's only been One night of love,
And maybe,
That is not enough,
Hold me tight,
Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe It's only been,
One night of love,
And maybe,
That is not enough,
Hold me tight,
Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe,
There's a firefly loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down,
And I lie if I,
Don't feel so right,
But the world looks better,
Through your eyes,
There's a firefly,
Loose tonight,
Better catch it before it burns this place down,
And I lie if I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better through your eyes"

Another day,
another life,
Passes by just like mine,
It's not complicated Another mind,
another soul,
Another body to grow old,
It's not complicated Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down,
Like autumn leaves,
And hush now,
Close your eyes before the sleep,
And you're miles away,
And yesterday you were here with me Another tear,
another cry,
Another place for us to die,
It's not complicated Another love that's gone to waste,
Another light lost from your face,
It's complicated Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you? Float down,
Like autumn leaves,
And hush now,
Close your eyes before the sleep,
And you're miles away,
And yesterday you were here with me Ooh,
how I miss you,
My symphony played the song that carried you out,
And ooh how I miss you,
And I miss you and I wish you'd stay Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down,
Like autumn leaves,
And hush now,
Close your eyes before the sleep,
And you're miles away,
And yesterday you were here with me (Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh,
Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh),
(Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh,
Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh) Touch down,
Like a seven four seven,
Stay out,
And we'll live forever now."
No,
no,
no,
no,
no I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans,
Goes to the gym at least six times a week,
Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet,
And I hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats,
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached,
Owns every single Ministry CD,
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means,
But I heard he makes you happy,
so that's fine by me,
But still,
I'm just keepin' it real,
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil',
I'll be tryin' not to double tap,
from way back,
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at,
Let me remind you of the days when,
You used to hold my hand,
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans,
I guess if you were Lois Lane,
I wasn't Superman,
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved,
So let me give it to ya I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to,
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,
I don't wanna know about your new man,
We'll get there eventually,
I know you're missing all this kind of love,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me Your new man rents a house in the 'burb,
And wears a man bag on his shoulder,
but I call it a purse,
Every year,
he goes to Malaga with all the fellas,
Drinks beer,
but has a six pack,
I'm kinda jealous,
He wears sunglasses indoors,
in winter,
at nighttime,
And every time a rap song comes on,
he makes a gang sign,
Says,
""Cheya!"",
boy never light up the room,
But enough about him,
girl,
let's talk about you,
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water reading,
Eatin' a packet of the crisp,
but you will never find you cheating,
Now you're eating kale,
hitting the gym,
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim,
In the back of the club,
kissing a boy that ain't him,
Okay,
you need to be alone,
And if you wanna talk about it,
you can call my phone,
I just thought I would tell you,
'cause you oughta know,
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved,
So let me give it to ya I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to,
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,
I don't wanna know about your new man,
We'll get there eventually,
I know you're missing all this kind of love,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me Baby,
I'm not trying to ruin your week,
But you act so differently,
When you're with him,
I know you're lonely,
Please remember you're still free,
To make the choice and leave,
Don't call me up,
you need to show me I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to,
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,
I don't wanna know about your new man,
We'll get there eventually,
I know you're missing all this kind of love,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about,
I don't wanna know about your new man"
She's like cold coffee in the morning,
I'm drunk off last night's whisky and coke,
She'll make me shiver without warning,
And make me laugh,
as if I'm in on joke And you can stay with me forever,
Or you could stay with me for now And tell me if I'm wrong,
And tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight,
Tell me if I know,
Tell me if I do,
Tell me how to fall in love The way you want me to,
I'll wake with coffee in the morning,
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea,
Outside,
the day is up and calling But I don't have to be,
So please go back to sleep And stay with me forever,
Or you could stay with me for now,
And tell me if I'm wrong,
And tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight,
Tell me if I know Tell me if I do,
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to 'Cause I love the way you wake me up,
For goodness sake will my love not be enough? Tell me if I'm wrong,
Tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight,
Tell me if I know,
Tell me if I do,
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to,
Tell me if I'm wrong,
Tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight"
I was twenty-four years old,
When I met the woman I would call my own,
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old,
In that house that your brother bought ya,
Oh the summer day when I proposed,
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold,
And I asked her father,
but her daddy said,
""No,
You can't marry my daughter"" She and I went on the run,
Don't care about religion,
I'm gonna marry the woman I love,
Down by the Wexford border,
She was Nancy Mulligan,
And I was William Sheeran,
She took my name and then we were one,
Down by the Wexford border Well,
met her at Guy's in the second world war,
And she was working on a soldier's ward,
Never had I seen such beauty before,
The moment that I saw her,
Nancy was my yellow rose,
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes,
We got eight children now growing old,
Five sons and three daughters She and I went on the run,
Don't care about religion,
I'm gonna marry the woman I love,
Down by the Wexford border,
She was Nancy Mulligan,
And I was William Sheeran,
She took my name and then we were one,
Down by the Wexford border From her snow white streak in her jet black hair,
Over sixteen years I've been loving her,
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs,
You know Nancy,
I adore ya,
From a farm boy born near Belfast town,
I never worried about the king and crown,
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground,
There's no difference,
I ensure ya She and I went on the run,
Don't care about religion,
I'm gonna marry the woman I love,
Down by the Wexford border,
She was Nancy Mulligan,
And I was William Sheeran,
She took my name and then we were one,
Down by the Wexford border"

I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe,
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak,
I drove miles and miles,
but would you do the same for me?,
Oh,
honestly?,
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon,
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm,
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song,
It goes on and on Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf,
My farewell,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain,
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or dream,
What line do we stand upon 'cause from here looks the same?,
And only scars remain Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf,
My farewell,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself But if don't,
Then I'll go back,
To where I'm rescuing a stranger,
Just because they needed saving just like that,
Oh,
I'm here again,
Between the devil and the danger,
But I guess it's just my nature,
My dad was wrong,
'Cause I'm not like my mum,
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song,
But it helps,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf,
My farewell,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself,
And before I blame someone else,
I've got to save myself,
And before I love someone else,
I've got to love myself"
You and I,
Two of a mind,
This love's,
One of a kind,
You and I,
We're drifting,
Over the edge,
And I will fall for you,
And I will fall for you,
If I fall for you,
Would you fall too? You and I,
Learning to speak,
With kisses on cheeks,
You and I,
We're lifted,
Over the edge,
And I will fall for you,
And I will fall for you If I fall for you Would you fall too?,
I will fall for you,
And I will fall for you,
If I fall for you,
Would you fall too?"
I was born inside a small town,
I lost that state of mind,
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house,
but stopped at the age of nine,
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride,
The paving stones I played upon,
they kept me on the grind,
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life,
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride,
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive,
And everyday that Satan tempts me,
I try to take it in my stride,
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs,
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun,
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up,
Instead,
I look in the mirror questioning what I've become,
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me,
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree,
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry,
Show me the locked doors,
I find another use for the key,
And you'll see I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me,
But with that said give me one more,
higher,
Another one to take the sting away,
I am happy on my own,
so here I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs,
I chased the pictured perfect life,
I think they painted it wrong,
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell,
Relationships and hearts you fixed,
they break as well,
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps,
Because you're living your dream,
man,
this shit should be fun,
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run,
I beg you,
don't be disappointed with the man I've become,
Our conversations with my father on the A14,
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams,
Now I'm playing for the people,
dad,
and they know me,
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans,
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou',
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud,
And to the next generation,
inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now,
Somehow I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me,
But with that said give me one more,
higher,
Another one to take the sting away,
Oh,
I am happy on my own,
so here I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser Welcome to the new show,
I guess you know I've been away,
But where I'm heading,
who knows,
But my heart will stay the same Welcome to the new show,
I guess you know I've been away,
But where I'm heading,
who knows,
My pain,
eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,

I've known it for a long time,
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine,
Disappearing all night,
I don't wanna know where he's been lying I know what I wanna do,
I wanna runaway,
Runaway with you,
Gonna grab clothes,
socks,
in the morning,
go How long you leaving?,
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening,
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this,
It's been a long day,
Thumb on side of the roadway,
but I love him from the skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows,
I'll just runaway and be on my own I've never seen my dad cry,
Cold as stone,
in the kitchen light,
I tell you it's about time,
But I was raised to keep quiet,
And this is what I'm gonna do,
Gonna runaway,
gonna make that move,
Gonna grab clothes,
and when it's morning,
go How long you leaving?,
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening,
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this,
It's been a long day,
Thumb on side of the roadway,
but I love him from the skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There's nothing to say and he knows,
I'll just runaway and be on my own Back pack,
and a flat cap,
turned to the back,
Cause I packed my closet,
My dad was a man without plans,
But taking turns to show love,
I don't wanna live this way,
Gonna take my things and go,
If things change in a matter of days,
Could be persuaded to hold up And mama was the same,
None of us are saints,
I guess that god knows that,
I don't wanna runaway,
And one of these days I might just show that,
Put my home in a suitcase,
Tie both showlaces,
and hope that,
Things change,
but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder I love him from the skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There's nothing to say and he knows,
I'll just runaway and be on my own"
If we take this bird in,
with its broken leg,
We could nurse it,
she said,
Come in side for a little lie down with me,
And if we fall asleep it would be the worst thing.,
But when i wake up,
and your makeup is on my shoulder,
And tell me if i lie down,
would you stay now?,
Let me hold ya,
ohh But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how i miss you,
strawberry's taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet,
mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret,
diving into soon.,
And i'll owe it all to you,
oh,
my little bird My little bird If we take a walk out,
in the morning dew,
We can lay down,
so i'm next you,
Come inside for a little home made tea,
And if you fall asleep,
then at least your next to me,
And if i wake up,
say its late love get back to sleep,
I'm covered by nature and i'm safe now,
Underneath this oak tree,
with you beside me But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how i miss you,
strawberry's taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet,
mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret,
diving into soon. And i'll owe it all to you,
oh,
my little bird My little bird My little bird My little bird And of all this thing i'm sure of,
i'm not quite certain of your love,
You made scream but then i made you cry when i left that little bird with its broken leg to die,
But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how i miss you,
strawberry's taste how lips do,
And its not complete yet,
mustn't get our feet wet,
Cause that leads to regret,

If this is to end in fire,
Then we should all burn together,
Watch the flames climb high into the night,
Calling out father,
oh,
stand by and we will Watch the flames burn auburn on,
The mountain side.,
And if we should die tonight Then we should all die together,
Raise a glass of wine for the last time,
Calling out father,
oh,
Prepare as we will Watch the flames burn auburn over,
The mountain side.,
Desolation comes upon the sky. Now I see fire,
Inside the mountain,
I see fire,
Burning the trees,
And I see fire Hollowing souls,
I see fire,
Blood in the breeze,
And I hope that you remember me.,
Oh,
should my people fall in,
Surely I'll do the same,
Confined in mountain halls,
We got too close to the flame,
Calling out father Hold fast and we will,
Watch the flames burn auburn on,
The mountain side.,
Desolation comes upon the sky. Now I see fire,
Inside the mountain,
I see fire,
Burning the trees,
And I see fire Hollowing souls,
And I see fire,
Blood in the breeze,
And I hope that you remember me.,
And if the night is burning,
I will cover my eyes,
For if the dark returns then,
My brothers will die,
And as the sky is falling down It crashed into this lonely town,
And with that shadow upon the ground,
I hear my people screaming out.,
Now I see fire,
Inside the mountain,
I see fire,
Burning the trees,
And I see fire,
Hollowing souls,
And I see fire,
Blood in the breeze.,
I see fire (Oh you know I saw a city burning) (fire),
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin,
yeah) (fire),
And I see fire (Uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire),
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side."
This is the start of something beautiful,
This is the start of something new,
You are the one that will make me lose it all,
You are the start of something new And I'll throw it all away,
And watch you fall into my arms again,
And I'll throw it all away,
And watch you fall,
now You are the earth I will stand upon,
You are the words I will sing And I've thrown it all away,
And watched you fall into his arms again,
And I've thrown it all away,
And watched you fall,
now And take me back,
Take me home,
Watch me fall,
down to earth,
Take me back For this is the start of something beautiful,
You are the start of something new"
This city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it's late,
Sirens bleed through my windowsill,
I can't close my eyes,
Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive,
The lights that blind,
keep me awake,
Hood up and lace untied,
Sleep fills my mind,
Can't control what I'm into London calls me a stranger,
A traveller,
This is now my home,
my home I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here,
sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps then that makes two The pavement is my friend,
It will take me where I need to go,
I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I'm used to And the shop across the road,
Fulfils my needs and gives me company,
When I need it,
Voices speak through my walls,
I don't think I'm gonna make it,
Past tomorrow London calls me a stranger,
A traveller,
This is now my home,
my home I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here,
sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps then that makes two And my lungs hurt and my ears bled,
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head,
Do I need this to keep me alive?,
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along London calls me a stranger,
This is not my home,
home I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here,
sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps then that makes two"
Bibia be ye ye I lost my shoes last night,
I don't know where I put my keys,
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree,
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar,
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee,
and all I know,
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat,
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain,
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again,
And tomorrow's a brand new day Someone told me,
""Always say what's on your mind"",
And I am only being honest with you,
I,
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time,
Se enioma enko ye,
bibia be ye ye,
Bibia be ye ye,
ye ye,
ye ye,
Bibia be ye ye I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret,
In my phone are several texts,
from girls I've never met,
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams,
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now,
Now things are looking up,
I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree,
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon,
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground,
And say you're with me,
tomorrow's a brand new day Someone told me,
""Always say what's on your mind"",
And I am only being honest with you,
I,
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time,
Se enioma enko ye,

Shock,
horror,
I'm down,
Lost,
you're not around,
There's a lump in my chest,
That sends cold through my head,
And my mind shuts sound out,
I'm on auto-pilot,
And my tongue's gone silent,
Just switch it off and lay it down,
Lay it down next to me I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,
you said,
you said,
That I miss you,
And I miss you These words mean nothing to me,
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be,
These three words are aching,
Constrict them,
suffocating,
My mind is racing,
With the picture I'm painting,
And my belly's sick to its stomach,
When I remember all the times it was with you when you laid it down,
You lay down next to me I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,
you said,
you said,
That I miss you More than I let on,
I kissed you,
Far too long,
I'll let go as soon as you do,
See I know we're not through I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,
you said,
you said,
That I miss you,
that I miss you,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,

I paid all my dues,
And she wanted to know,
That I'd never leave her,
Now I'm ready to go As strange as it seems,
She's endless to me,
She's just like paperwork but harder to read,
Patience's my enemy,
Loving's my friend,
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve Than to stay and just pretend,
Oh she,
knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
I made all my plans,
And as she has made hers,
She kept me in mind,
But I wasn't sure,
I searched every room For a way to escape,
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for dear life,
And blocking my way,
Patience's my enemy Loving's my friend,
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve,
Than to stay and just pretend,
Oh she,
knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
And like the back of her hand she already understands everything ""Won't you stay"" she says,
And she already knows how it goes,
And where she stands I'll stay,
anyway,
'Cause she knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
Oh she,
knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
I know myself,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
I know myself,
I know myself,

Goodbye Norma Jean,
Though I never knew you at all,
You had the grace to hold yourself,
While those around you crawled,
They crawled out of the woodwork,
And they whispered into your brain,
They set you on the treadmill,
And they made you change your name And it seems to me you lived your life,
Like a candle in the wind,
Never knowing who to cling to,
When the rain set in,
And I would have liked to have known you,
But I was just a kid,
Your candle burned out long before,
Your legend ever did Loneliness was tough,
The toughest role you ever played,
Hollywood created a superstar,
And pain was the price you paid,
Even when you died,
Oh the press still hounded you,
All the papers had to say,
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude And it seems to me you lived your life,
Like a candle in the wind,
Never knowing who to cling to,
When the rain set in,
And I would have liked to have known you,
But I was just a kid,
Your candle burned out long before,
Your legend ever did Goodbye Norma Jean,
Though I never knew you at all,
You had the grace to hold yourself,
While those around you crawled,
Goodbye Norma Jean,
From the young man in the 22nd row,
Who sees you as something as more than sexual,
More than just our Marilyn Monroe And it seems to me you lived your life,
Like a candle in the wind,
Never knowing who to cling to,
When the rain set in,
And I would have liked to have known you,
But I was just a kid,
Your candle burned out long before,
Your legend ever did"
It's alright to cry,
Even my dad does sometimes,
So don't wipe your eyes,
Tears remind you you're alive,
It's alright to die,
Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried,
But just for tonight,
Hold on So live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart It's alright to shake,
Even my hand does sometimes,
So inside we rage,
Against the dying of the lights,
It's alright to say,
That death's the only thing you haven't tried,
But just for today,
Hold on So live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart,
Hold on Live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart,
Hold on"
I didn't mean to break your heart,
I was just lonely,
And everybody falls apart sometimes,
I know you've found another one,
But won't you just hold me tonight? I wish I never called you up,
Nobody told me,
And they don't know,
we don't speak anymore,
So take a good look at us,
And won't you just hold me tonight? And I would stop trying to fall in love again,
And keep it a secret,
It never works out anyway,
But I am not,
anything like I was,
Cause you were the only one for me,
Yeah Cause maybe I don't want to lose,
A lover and friend in one night,
If that's alright,
I shouldn't have fcked with your mind,
And your life too many times,
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely,
Darling you are my only love,
Behind my truth lies everything you are I never meant to sleep around,
I was just lonely,
And you did the same,
Again,
and again,
and again,
Woah,
I know,
So here's to the both of us,
Here's to our story tonight Oh I would stop trying to fall in love again,
And keep it a secret,
It never works out anyway,
But I am not,
anything like I was,
Cause you were the only one for me,
Yeah Cause maybe I don't want to lose,

Behind my truth lies everything you are When I see my future,
It is with you,
We'll get there,
And I'll want my children,
To be with you,

The club isn't the best place to find a lover,
So the bar is where I go,
Me and my friends at the table doing shots,
Drinking fast and then we talk slow,
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me,
And trust me I'll give it a chance now,
Take my hand,
stop,
put Van the Man on the jukebox,
And then we start to dance,
and now I'm singing like Girl,
you know I want your love,
Your love was handmade for somebody like me,
Come on now,
follow my lead,
I may be crazy,
don't mind me,
Say,
boy,
let's not talk too much,
Grab on my waist and put that body on me,
Come on now,
follow my lead,
Come,
come on now,
follow my lead I'm in love with the shape of you,
We push and pull like a magnet do,
Although my heart is falling too,
I'm in love with your body,
And last night you were in my room,
And now my bedsheets smell like you,
Every day discovering something brand new,
I'm in love with your body,
Oh--I--oh--I--oh--I--oh--I,
I'm in love with your body,
Oh--I--oh--I--oh--I--oh--I,
I'm in love with your body,
Oh--I--oh--I--oh--I--oh--I,
I'm in love with your body,
Every day discovering something brand new,
I'm in love with the shape of you Check it,
I've gotta tell you,
I'm in love with your shape,
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight,
And you were shy in the beginning,
used to cover your face,
You got that sweet,

Girl,

that's real talk,
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack,
And when you've finished what you're doing,
we'll be kicking it back,
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps,
And I've got money in the bank,
but not a figure like that,
You got me looking at your shape,
man,
I've already won,
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done,
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride,
Let me multiply your lovin',
then I hit you with Divide,
check it I'm in love with the shape of you,
We push and pull like a magnet do,
Although my heart is falling too,
I'm in love with your body,
And last night you were in my room,
And now my bedsheets smell like you,
Every day discovering something brand new,
I'm in love with your body,
Oh--I--oh--I--oh--I--oh--I,

I'm so impressed,
Come on,

Baby,

I won't be talking on Twitter,

Come on,

Girl,

I'll turn your curse to a blessing,
that's overnight,
Come on,
be my baby,
come on,
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem,
I'll do you right I'm in love with the shape of you,
We push and pull like a magnet do,
Although my heart is falling too,
I'm in love with your body,
Last night you were in my room,
And now my bedsheets smell like you,

You look so perfect standing there,
In my American Apparel underwear,

And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it,
Would you wanna run away too?,
'Cause all I really want is you,

White lips,
pale face,
Breathing in snowflakes,
Burnt lungs,
sour taste Light's gone,
day's end,
Struggling to pay rent,
Long nights,
strange men And they say,
She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,
Been this way since eighteen,
But lately,,
Her face seems,
Slowly sinking,
wasting,
Crumbling like pastries,
And they scream,
The worst things in life come free to us 'Cause we're just under the upper hand,
And go mad for a couple grams,
And she don't want to go outside tonight,
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland,
Or sells love to another man,
It's too cold outside,
For angels to fly,
Angels to fly Ripped gloves,
raincoat,
Tried to swim and stay afloat,
Dry house,
wet clothes,
Loose change,
bank notes,
Weary-eyed,
dry throat,
Call girl,
no phone And they say,
She's in the Class A Team,
Stuck in her daydream,

For angels to fly An angel will die,
Covered in white,

I think I talk too much,
I'm addicted to your touch,
But I'm crying,
In shame again,
And now I'm high as a kite,
And I know I might be gone,
When you get home,
Oh well,
we've come this far,
You're my Venus,
And I'm your Mars,
And we've passed the moon,
And stars,
And I'm gone,
But now I'm high as a kite,
And I know I'm might be gone,
When you get home,
I'm high as a kite,
And I know I'm almost gone,
When you get home,
So please come home"
Things were all good yesterday,
And then the devil took your memory,
And if you fell to your death today,
I hope that heaven is your resting place,
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain,
But then that could have been the medicine,
And now you're lying in the bed again,
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them My father told me,
son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
You're not the only one,
Although my grandma used to say,
He used to sing Darlin' hold me in your arms,
The way you did last night,
And we'll die inside,
For a little while here oh I could look into your eyes,
Until the sun comes up,
And we're wrapped in light and life and love,
Put your open lips on mine,
And slowly let them shut,
For they're designed to be together oh,
With your body next to mine,
Our hearts will beat as one,
And we set alight,
We're afire love Love,
love Things were all good yesterday,
Then the devil took your breath away,
Now we're left here in the pain,
Black suit black tie standing in the rain,
And now my family is one again,
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend,
Came to my mind I should paint it with a pen,
Six years old I remember when My father told me,
son,
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face,
You're not the only one,
Although my grandma used to say,
He used to sing Darlin' hold me in your arms,

It's just another night,
And I'm staring at the moon,
I saw a shooting star,
And thought of you,
I sang a lullaby,
By the waterside and knew,
If you were here,
I'd sing to you You're on the other side,
As the skyline splits in two,
I'm miles away from seeing you I can see the stars,
From America?,
I wonder,
do you see them,
too? So open your eyes and see,
The way our horizons meet,
And all of the lights will lead,
Into the night with me,
And I know these scars will bleed,
But both of our hearts believe,
All of these stars will guide us home I can hear your heart,
On the radio beat,
They're playing 'Chasing Cars',
And I thought of us,
Back to the time,
You were lying next to me,
I looked across and fell in love So I took your hand,
Back through lamplit streets and knew,
Everything led back to you So can you see the stars,
Over Amsterdam?,
You're the song my heart is beating to So open your eyes and see,
The way our horizons meet,
And all of the lights will lead,
Into the night with me,
And I know these scars will bleed,
But both of our hearts believe,
All of these stars will guide us home And oh,
And oh,
And oh I can see the stars,
From America"
Another day,
another life,
Passes by just like mine,
It's not complicated Another mind,
another soul,
Another body to grow old,
It's not complicated Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down,
Like autumn leaves,
And hush now,
Close your eyes before the sleep,
And you're miles away,
And yesterday you were here with me Another tear,
another cry,
Another place for us to die,
It's not complicated Another love that's gone to waste,
Another light lost from your face,
It's complicated Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you? Float down,
Like autumn leaves,
And hush now,
Close your eyes before the sleep,
And you're miles away,
And yesterday you were here with me Ooh,
how I miss you,
My symphony played the song that carried you out,
And ooh how I miss you,
And I miss you and I wish you'd stay Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you? Float down,
Like autumn leaves,
And hush now,
Close your eyes before the sleep,
And you're miles away,
And yesterday you were here with me (Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh,
Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh),
(Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh,
Mmm-mm-mmh,
mm-mmh) Touch down,
Like a seven four seven,
Stay out,
And we'll live forever now."
Oh baby,

How was I supposed to know,
That something wasn't right here?,
Oh baby,

I shouldn't have let you go,
'Cause now you're out of sight,

Tell me,

Hit me baby one more time Oh baby,

Happy days,
That left us on the floor,
And you squeeze me,
Till you're not feeling sure,
Everything will brighten up,
If we go to Brighton,
I'll take you along the Pier,
Everything will lighten up and If you feel too frightened,
I'll make things disappear,
dear,
Darling,
don't be nervous I'll understand,
If you'll let me go,
I did this on purpose,
Now,
cause when I'm missing you,
I'll stop eating food,
And I'll squeeze into a dress,
So I can be like you And then I'll see your bitterness,
And why you're leaving too,
Maybe,
I'll put you to a test,
And say that I love you,
I think that I love you,
Sunny days,
That left my skin dark red,
And you breathe me,
Till these thoughts leave my head,
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated,
Can you see what's wrong?,
If you feel like you've been jaded and This love's too overrated,
See what's going on,
on,
Darling,
don't be nervous,
I'll understand,
If you'll let me go,
I did this on purpose,
Now,
cause when I'm missing you I'll stop eating food,
And I'll squeeze into a dress,
So I can be like you,
And then I'll see your bitterness,
And why you're leaving too,
Maybe,
I'll put you to a test,
And say that I love you,
I think that I love you Take me back to live at home,
Take me back to Albert Road,
Cause when I'm missing you,
I'll stop eating food,
And I'll squeeze into your dress,
So I can feel like you,
And then I'll see your bitterness,
And why you left me too,
I thought I'd put you to a test,
And say that I love you,
I think that I love you,
And I'll stop eating food,
And I squeeze into your dress,
So I can feel like you,
And then I'll see your bitterness,
And why you left me too,
I thought I'd put you to a test,
And say that I love you,
Now it seems you loved me too"
Bibia be ye ye I lost my shoes last night,
I don't know where I put my keys,
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree,
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar,
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee,
and all I know,
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat,
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain,
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again,
And tomorrow's a brand new day Someone told me,
""Always say what's on your mind"",
And I am only being honest with you,
I,
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time,
Se enioma enko ye,
bibia be ye ye,
Bibia be ye ye,
ye ye,
ye ye,
Bibia be ye ye I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret,
In my phone are several texts,
from girls I've never met,
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams,
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now,
Now things are looking up,
I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree,
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon,
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground,
And say you're with me,
tomorrow's a brand new day Someone told me,
""Always say what's on your mind"",
And I am only being honest with you,
I,
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time,

I've been spinning now for time,
Couple women by my side I got sinning on my mind,
Sipping on red wine,
I've been sitting here for ages,
Ripping out the pages,
How'd I get so faded,
How'd I get so faded?,
Oh no no,
don't leave me lonely now,
If you loved me how'd you never learn Ooh,
coloured crimson in my eyes,
One or two could free my mind,
This is how it ends,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream Fading out again,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream,
So tell me when it kicks in,
Hmmmm,
hmmmm,
hmmmm,
Well tell me when it kicks in Hmmmm,
hmmmm,
hmmmm,
I've been looking for a lover,
Thought I'd find her in a bottle God,
make me another one,
I'll be feeling this tomorrow,
Lord,
forgive me for the things I've done,
I was never meant to hurt no one,
And I saw scars upon a brokenhearted lover,
Oh no no,
don't leave me lonely now,
If you loved me how'd you never learn Ooh,
coloured crimson in my eyes,
One or two could free my mind,
This is how it ends,
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream Fading out again,

So tell me when it kicks in,

Goodbye Norma Jean,
Though I never knew you at all,
You had the grace to hold yourself,
While those around you crawled,
They crawled out of the woodwork,
And they whispered into your brain,
They set you on the treadmill,
And they made you change your name And it seems to me you lived your life,
Like a candle in the wind,
Never knowing who to cling to,
When the rain set in,
And I would have liked to have known you,
But I was just a kid,
Your candle burned out long before,
Your legend ever did Loneliness was tough,
The toughest role you ever played,
Hollywood created a superstar,
And pain was the price you paid,
Even when you died,
Oh the press still hounded you,
All the papers had to say,
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude And it seems to me you lived your life,
Like a candle in the wind,
Never knowing who to cling to,
When the rain set in,
And I would have liked to have known you,
But I was just a kid,
Your candle burned out long before,
Your legend ever did Goodbye Norma Jean,
Though I never knew you at all,
You had the grace to hold yourself,
While those around you crawled,
Goodbye Norma Jean,
From the young man in the 22nd row,
Who sees you as something as more than sexual,
More than just our Marilyn Monroe And it seems to me you lived your life,
Like a candle in the wind,
Never knowing who to cling to,
When the rain set in,
And I would have liked to have known you,
But I was just a kid,
Your candle burned out long before,
Your legend ever did"
When I was six years old,
I broke my leg,
I was running from my brother and his friends,
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down,
I was younger then,
take me back to when I Found my heart and broke it here,
Made friends and lost them through the years,
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long,
I know I've grown,
but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes,
Running from the law through the backfields and,
Getting drunk with my friends,
Had my first kiss on a Friday night,
I don't reckon that I did it right,
but I was younger then,
take me back to when,
We found weekend jobs,
when we got paid,
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight,
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long,
Oh,
how we've grown,
but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill One friend left to sell clothes,
One works down by the coast,
One had two kids,
but lives alone,
One's brother overdosed,
One's already on his second wife,
One's just barely getting by,
but,
These people raised me,
And I can't wait to go home And I'm on my way,
I still remember these old country lanes,
When we did not know the answers,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill"

but I can't wait to go home I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to Tiny Dancer,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill One friend left to sell clothes,
One works down by the coast,
One had two kids,
but lives alone,
One's brother overdosed,
One's already on his second wife,
One's just barely getting by,
but,
These people raised me,
And I can't wait to go home And I'm on my way,
I still remember these old country lanes,
When we did not know the answers,
And I miss the way you make me feel,
and it's real,
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill"
When I was six years old I broke my leg,
I was running from my brother and his friends,
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down I was younger then,
Take me back to when I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer"",
And I miss the way,
You make me feel,
And it's real,
When we watched the sunset,
Over the castle on the hill Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes,
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends,
Had my first kiss on a Friday night,
I don't reckon that I did it right I was younger then,,
Take me back to when I'm on my way,
Driving at 90 down those country lanes,
Singing to ""Tiny Dancer"",
And I miss the way,
You make me feel,
And it's real,
When we watched the sunset,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill One friend left to sell clothes,
One works down by the coast,
One had two kids but lives alone,
One's brother overdosed,
One's already on his second wife,
One's just barely getting by,
But these people raised me,
And I can't wait to go home And I'm on my way,
I still remember these old country lanes,
When we did not know the answers,
And I miss the way,
You make me feel,
And it's real,
When we watched the sunset,
Over the castle on the hill,
Over the castle on the hill"
She's like cold coffee in the morning,
I'm drunk off last night's whisky and coke,
She'll make me shiver without warning,
And make me laugh,
as if I'm in on joke And you can stay with me forever,
Or you could stay with me for now And tell me if I'm wrong,
And tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight,
Tell me if I know,
Tell me if I do,
Tell me how to fall in love The way you want me to,
I'll wake with coffee in the morning,
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea,
Outside,
the day is up and calling But I don't have to be,
So please go back to sleep And stay with me forever,
Or you could stay with me for now,
And tell me if I'm wrong,
And tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight,
Tell me if I know Tell me if I do,
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to 'Cause I love the way you wake me up,
For goodness sake will my love not be enough? Tell me if I'm wrong,
Tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight,
Tell me if I know,
Tell me if I do,
Tell me how to fall in love the way you want me to,
Tell me if I'm wrong,
Tell me if I'm right,
Tell me if you need a loving hand,
To help you fall asleep tonight"
Your love is the strongest thing I know,
I reckon it's been doing weights,
Eating raw eggs in it's cereal,
And running ten miles a day.,
And your love has a driving ban,,
For trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands,,
And your love is a friend of mine,
So we'll take it care tonight If you could only say the words,
I'd take it and I'd write it down,
And hold it deep inside of me,
Until the day you found me out,
But I know your love,,
And that's why I could be your diary,,
Baby if you open me up.,
Keep it inside me,,
I'll give you the world,,
Just give me the words.,
And I could be your diary,,
Baby if you open me up.,
Keep it inside me,,
I'll give you the world,,
Just give me the words. And your love,,
Has never been my enemy.,
Used to hold me,
And promise it would never leave.,
Never been better since all the therapy,
To read the words between the lines,
And take away my melody.,
And your love,,
Told me it was going to a different page.,
And you know,
if I let you go,,
I'll still keep you safe. If you could only say the words,
I'd take it and I'd write it down,
And hold it deep inside of me,
Until the day you found me out,
But I know your love,
And that's why I could be your diary,,
Baby if you open me up.,
Keep it inside me,,
I'll give you the world,
Just give me the words.,
And I could be your diary,,
Baby if you open me up.,
Keep it inside me,,
I'll give you the world,
Just give me the words. You are the one I fall asleep with,
But never wake up to,
Cause work is something you must do,
I trust you like you trust me,
It must mean true love,
It does exactly what it says on the tin,
Let me begin,
You are the one I watch the movies with,
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is,
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again,
But you're actually the same,
It's just to spite me,
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it,
Until the dishes finished,
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it,
I tried to make tea once for you in bed,
But all I did was spill it,
So you made it for me instead,
Let me in bed,
If you get in ahead of me,
It's better to do,
Yeah,
love is ahead of the truth,
But in love,
We are better in two,
I'll be the newcomer,
Stuck in heaven with the devil in you Diary,
Baby if you open me up.,
Keep it inside me,,
I'll give you the world,
Just give me the words.,
And I could be your diary,,
Baby if you open me up.,
Keep it inside me,,
I'll give you the world,
Just give me the words.,
Yeah"
Oh,
maybe I came on too strong,
Maybe I waited too long,
Maybe I played my cards wrong,
Oh,
just a little bit wrong,
Baby I apologize for it I could fall or I could fly,
Here in your aeroplane,
And I could live,
I could die,
Hanging on the words you say,
And I've been known to give my all,
And jumping in harder than,
Ten thousand rocks on the lake So don't call me baby,
Unless you mean it,
Don't tell me you need me,
If you don't believe it,
So let me know the truth,
Before I dive right into you You're a mystery,
I have traveled the world,
there's no other girl like you,
No one,
what's your history?,
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?,
'Cause I heard you do,
mmh I could fall or I could fly,
Here in your aeroplane,
And I could live,
I could die,
Hanging on the words you say,
And I've been known to give my all,
And lie awake,
every day,
Don't know how much I can take So don't call me baby,
Unless you mean it,
Don't tell me you need me,
If you don't believe it,
So let me know the truth,
Before I dive right into you I could fall or I could fly,
Here in your aeroplane,
And I could live,
I could die,
Hanging on the words you say,
And I've been known to give my all,
Sitting back,
looking at,
Every mess that I made So don't call me baby,
Unless you mean it,
Don't tell me you need me,
If you don't believe it,
So let me know the truth,
Before I dive right into you,
Before I dive right into you,
Before I dive right into you"
La,
la,
la,
la I met this girl late last year,
She said don't you worry if I disappear,
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake,
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait But then I jumped right in a week later returned,
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn,
But I gave her my time for two or three nights,
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right I went away for months until our paths crossed again,
She told me I was never looking for a friend,
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten,
Baby,
bring the lemon & a bottle of gin,
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM,
Baby if you wanted me then you should have just said,
She's singing...,
la,
la,
la,
la,
Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that,
babe la,
la,
la Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe la,
la,
la For a couple of weeks I only want to see her,
We drink away the days with a take away pizza,
Before a text message was the only way to reach her,
Now she's staying at my place & loves the way I treat her Singing out Aretha,
all over the track like a feature,
And never wants to sleep I guess that I don't want to either,
But me & her we make money the same way,
Four cities,
two planes the same day And those shows have never been what it's about,
Maybe we'll go together & just figure it out,
I'd rather put on a film with you & sit on the couch,
But we should get on the plane or we'll be missing it now Wish I'd have written it down,
the way that things played out,
When she was kissing him how I was confused about,
She should figure it out why I'm sat here singing Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that,
babe,
Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe On my hotel door!,
I don't even know if she knows what for,
She was crying on my shoulder,
I already told you,
Trust & respect is what we do this for I never intended to be next,
But you didn't need to take him to bed,
that's all,
And I never saw him as a threat,
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course It's not like we were both on tour,
We were staying on the same hotel floor,
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment,
But it was never just fun & I thought you were different This is not the way you realize what you wanted,
It's a bit too much,
too late if I'm honest,
And all this time God knows I'm singing Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that,
babe,
Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe Don't with my love,
That heart is so cold,
All over my own,
I don't wanna know that babe,
Don't with my love,
I told her,
she knows,
Take aim & reload,
I don't wanna know that,
babe"
I wanna be drunk when I wake up,
On the right side of the wrong bed,
And never an excuse I made up,
Tell you the truth I hate,
What didn't kill me,,
It never made me stronger at all Love will scar your makeup,,
Lip sticks to me,
So now I maybe lean back there,
I'm sat here,,
Wishing I was sober,
I know I'll never hold you like I used to But a house gets cold when you cut the heating,
Without you to hold I'll be freezing,
Can't rely on my heart to beat in,
Cause you take parts of it every evening,
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing,
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?',
Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
To feel a little love I wanna hold your heart in both hands,
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can,
And I've got no plans for the weekend,
So should we speak then?,
Keep it between friends?,
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to There may be other people like us,
Who see the flicker of a clipper when they light up,
Flames just create us,
Burns don't heal like before,
And you don't hold me anymore On cold days cold plays out like the band's name,
I know I can't heal things with a handshake,
You know I can change,,
As I began saying,
You cut me wide open like landscape,
Open bottles of beer but never champagne,
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make,
Should I? Should I? Maybe I'll get drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
To feel a little love All by myself,
I'm here again,
All by myself,
You know I'll never change,
All by myself,
All by myself I'm just drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
I'll be drunk,
again,
To feel a little love"
I've been drinking,
I've been drinking,
(He been drinking),
I get filthy when that liquor's in me baby,
I've been thinking,
I've been thinking,
Why can't I keep my fingers off it,
baby? I want you,
na-na Why can't I keep my fingers off it,
baby? I want you,
na-na,
Cigars on ice,
cigars on ice,
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill,
Flashing lights,
flashing lights,
You got me faded,
faded,
faded,
baby,
I want you,
na-na,
You got me faded,
faded,
faded,
baby,
I want you,
na-na,
Drunk in love I want you,
We woke up in the kitchen saying,
""How the hell did this shit happen?"",
Oh baby,
drunk in love,
We be all night,
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club Drunk in love,
we be all night,
Love,
love,
We be all night,
Love,
love,
I've drinking,
Brain right,
gangster wife,
Louis rags,
he sweat it out He sweat it out,
I wear that,
Boy I'm drinking,
I'm on the mic till my voice horse,
Then I fill the tub up halfway,
then I ride it with my surfboard,
Surfboard,
surfboard,
Graining on that wood,
grain,
graining on that wood I'm swerving on that,
Swerve swerving on that big body,
Just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood,
We woke up in the kitchen saying,
""How the hell did this shit happen?"",
Oh baby,
drunk in love,
We be all night,
Last thing I remember is our beautiful bodies grinding up in that club,
Dunk in love,
Now we be all night,
Love,
love,
We be all night,
Love,

We be all night,
Love,
love,
We be all night,
Love,

Across the sea,
By the Tennessee skyline,
They told me I'd find my,
Hopes and my dreams But I long to be,
In the bed of my true love,
Back where I came from,
She's waiting for me So I'll make my way,
Through long winding country roads,
But my heart still beats,
For my home and my English rose I told my dad,
On the phone it's amazing,
From the straight to the crazy,
These places I've seen But I long to be,
In the arms of my true love,
Like he loves my mother,
He understands me I'll spend my days,
Just travelling and playing shows,
But my heart still beats,
For my home and my English rose I met a man,
In the bar down in Memphis,
And he told me he went there,
To follow his dreams He told me ""Son,
You know I lost my true love,
For the same exact reason,
That you crossed the sea"" And I found truth,
In people I barely know,
But my heart still beats,
For my home and my English rose,
Oh my heart still beats,
For my home and my English rose,
Oh my heart still beats,
For my home and my English rose"
I was born inside a small town,
I lost that state of mind,
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house,
but stopped at the age of nine,
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride,
The paving stones I played upon,
they kept me on the grind,
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life,
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride,
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive,
And everyday that Satan tempts me,
I try to take it in my stride,
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs,
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun,
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up,
Instead,
I look in the mirror questioning what I've become,
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me,
Without a nine-to-five job or an uni degree,
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry,
Show me the locked doors,
I find another use for the key,
And you'll see I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me,
But with that said give me one more,
higher,
Another one to take the sting away,
I am happy on my own,
so here I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs,
I chased the pictured perfect life,
I think they painted it wrong,
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell,
Relationships and hearts you fixed,
they break as well,
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps,
Because you're living your dream,
man,
this shit should be fun,
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run,
I beg you,
don't be disappointed with the man I've become,
Our conversations with my father on the A14,
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams,
Now I'm playing for the people,
dad,
and they know me,
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans,
Wembley Stadium crowd's two-hundred-and-forty-thou',
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud,
And to the next generation,
inspiration's allowed The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now,
Somehow I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me,
But with that said give me one more,
higher,
Another one to take the sting away,
Oh,
I am happy on my own,
so here I'll stay,
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser Welcome to the new show,
I guess you know I've been away,
But where I'm heading,
who knows,
But my heart will stay the same Welcome to the new show,
I guess you know I've been away,
But where I'm heading,
who knows,
My pain,
eraser And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser,
And I'll find comfort in my pain,
eraser"
It's alright to cry,
Even my dad does sometimes,
So don't wipe your eyes,
Tears remind you you're alive,
It's alright to die,
Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried,
But just for tonight,
Hold on So live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart It's alright to shake,
Even my hand does sometimes,
So inside we rage,
Against the dying of the lights,
It's alright to say,
That death's the only thing you haven't tried,
But just for today,
Hold on So live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart,
Hold on Live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart,
Hold on"
I didn't mean to break your heart,
I was just lonely,
And everybody falls apart sometimes,
I know you've found another one,
But won't you just hold me tonight? I wish I never called you up,
Nobody told me,
And they don't know,
we don't speak anymore,
So take a good look at us,
And won't you just hold me tonight? And I would stop trying to fall in love again,
And keep it a secret,
It never works out anyway,
But I am not,
anything like I was,
Cause you were the only one for me,
Yeah Cause maybe I don't want to lose,
A lover and friend in one night,
If that's alright,
I shouldn't have fcked with your mind,
And your life too many times,
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely,
Darling you are my only love,
Behind my truth lies everything you are I never meant to sleep around,
I was just lonely,
And you did the same,
Again,
and again,
and again,
Woah,
I know,
So here's to the both of us,
Here's to our story tonight Oh I would stop trying to fall in love again,
And keep it a secret,
It never works out anyway,
But I am not,
anything like I was,
Cause you were the only one for me,
Yeah Cause maybe I don't want to lose,
A lover and friend in one night,
If that's alright,
I shouldn't have fcked with your mind,
And your life too many times,
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely,
Darling you are my only love,
Behind my truth lies everything you are When I see my future,
It is with you,
We'll get there,
And I'll want my children,
To be with you,
We'll get there Cause maybe I don't want to lose,
A lover and friend in one night,
If that's alright,
I shouldn't have fcked with your mind,
And your life too many times,
Or maybe I don't want to be lonely,
Darling you are my only love,
Behind my truth lies everything you are,
Behind my truth lies everything you are,
Behind my truth lies everything you are"
You and I,
Two of a mind,
This love's,
One of a kind,
You and I,
We're drifting,
Over the edge,
And I will fall for you,
And I will fall for you,
If I fall for you,
Would you fall too? You and I,
Learning to speak,
With kisses on cheeks,
You and I,
We're lifted,
Over the edge,
And I will fall for you,
And I will fall for you If I fall for you Would you fall too?,
I will fall for you,
And I will fall for you,
If I fall for you,
Would you fall too?"
Hmm let me go,,
To see my family.,
Please Father let me go,,
As my mother sleeps. I don't know about days gone,,
But round here nobody lives twice.,
When your gone,
your gone,
without no bye,,
Because only a judge can give you life.,
This is my advice,,
Trust me,
I nearly lost my life.,
3 weeks after I got this rhyme,,
It seems like I had too much wine.,
Which that I I didn't get one,,
Anyway,
I was going to the? booked for a set,,
Even though I didn't have a set one.,
Skream hit the decks,
I was like check one.,
Put on a show,
but it weren't my best one.,
Left it,
dropped off Blacks at his destination,,
Then I was off to the next one,,
20 minutes later I was on the M1,,
Tired.,
But I kept on going,,
Fell asleep without even knowing.,
No motion in my face,,
No movement in my legs,
but the car still kept going.,
Woke up,,
Lorry,,
Flash,,
Panic,,
Break,,
Skid,,
Crash,,
Skidded,,
More,,
Bang,,
Smash,,
Out,,
Cold,,
Ribs,,
Cracked,,
Ouch.,
I was in so much pain,,
Crawled out of a Megan that now looked like a Mini,,
When I was still on the first lane.,
Baffled,
didn't even know my name.,
Fainted,
too much shock in my brain.,
Surrounded by paramedics and feds,,
Trying to get up but fainted again. I just want you to take a second,
hear me out.,
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out.,
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared,,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,,
To see my family,,
And keep it inside,,
Dry eyes,
while my brother weeps.,
Save my soul,,
Please Father let me go.,
Keep me safe,
as my mother sleeps. Eyes closed,
they just wouldn't open,,
I can hear voices and my phone ringing.,
Fighting for life,
can't tell if I'm winning,,
One of the worst situations I've been in.,
I can hear all of the angels singing. But when it stopped humming,,
My brain turned on,
stared running.,
Still in pain,
but it started numbing,,
the stone cold comeback I made was stunning.,
I still tried to do a few shows cuz I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming.,
But I was left with a permanent problem,,
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in (inside).,
Ever so cunning,,
6 weeks later,
jogging and running.,
I used the first air kit like a drum set,,
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming.,
Trust me,
when it comes to mistakes,,
You can't afford to let one in.,
Never done dream for a while,,
The black plan was blocked,,
So I learnt and done a bit of plumbing.,
They say tomorrow never dies,,
But he forgot to tell you 'you can'.,
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang,,
But when your time's up,
that's it,
it's you fam.,
You can try beg for another,,
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show,,
Thinking 'I just wanna see my brother',,
Then do a U-turn,
I'm gone,
Runner. I just want you to take a second,
hear me out.,
Don't think I'm happy cuz I smile when you see me out.,
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared.,
Oh I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go,,
To see my family.,
And keep it inside,,
Dry eyes,
while my brother weeps.,
Save my soul."
The rain won't stop falling,
It's harder than before,
This car keeps on stalling,
Pedal to the floor What I need to know,
Is if you love me and I really need to know,
Is if you want me when you call,
If you want me when you call We were young and we were foolish,
School books in our arms,
Dodging homework,
dodging classes,
To set off fire alarms And what I need to know,
Is if you love me and I really need to know,
If you need me when you call,
If you want me when you call We are waving our lives away,
We are waving our lives away,
We are waving our lives away,
We are waving our lives away We are waving,
(And what I need to know),
We are waving,
(Is if you love me and I) We are waving,
(Really need to know),
We are waving,
(If you need me when you call) We are waving,
(What I need to know),
We are waving,
(Is if you love me and I) We are waving,
(Really need to know),
We are waving,
(If you need me when you call) What I need to know,
Is if you love me and I really need to know,
If you need me when you call,
If you want me when you call"
I fell in love next to you,
Burning fires in this room,
It just fits,
Light and smooth,
Like my feet in my shoes,
Little one,
lie with me,
Sew you heart to my sleeve,
We'll stay quiet,
Underneath shooting stars,
If it helps you sleep,
And hold me tight,
Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe There's a firefly,
Loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down,
And I lie,
If I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better Through your eyes There's a firefly,
Loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down,
And I lie,
If I don't feel so right But the world looks better,
Through your eyes Teach my skin,
Those new tricks,
Warm me up,
With your lips,
Heart to heart,
Melt me down,
It's too cold,
In this town,
Close your eyes,
Lean on me,
Face to mouth,
Lips to cheek,
Feeling numb,
In my feet You're the one,
To help me get to sleep,
And hold me tight Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe,
There's a firefly Loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down And I lie,
If I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better,
Through your eyes,
There's a firefly Loose tonight,
Better catch it Before it burns this place down,
And I lie,
If I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better,
Through your eyes,
It's only been One night of love,
And maybe,
That is not enough,
Hold me tight,
Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe It's only been,
One night of love,
And maybe,
That is not enough,
Hold me tight,
Don't let me breathe,
Feeling like,
You won't believe,
There's a firefly loose tonight,
Better catch it,
Before it burns this place down,
And I lie if I,
Don't feel so right,
But the world looks better,
Through your eyes,
There's a firefly,
Loose tonight,
Better catch it before it burns this place down,
And I lie if I don't feel so right,
But the world looks better through your eyes"
We're not,
No we're not friends,
Nor have we ever been,
We just try to keep those secrets in a lie,
And if they find out,
will it all go wrong,
And heaven knows no one wants it to,
So I could take the back road,
But your eyes will lead me straight back home,
And if you know me like I know you,
You should love me,
you should know,
Friends just sleep in another bed,
And friends don't treat me like you do,
Well I know that there's a limit to everything,
But my friends won't love me like you,
No,
my friends won't love me like you We're not friends,
We could be anything,
If we try to keep those secrets safe,
No one will find out,
If it all went wrong,
They'll never know what we've been through,
So I could take the back road,
But your eyes will lead me straight back home,
And if you know me like I know you,
You should love me,
you should know,
That friends just sleep in another bed,
And friends don't treat me like you do,
Well I know that there's a limit to everything,
But my friends won't love me like you No,
my friends won't love me like you But then again,
if we're not friends,
Someone else might love you too And then again,
if we're not friends,
There'd be nothing I could do And that's why friends should sleep in other beds,
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do,
And I know that there's a limit to everything,
But my friends won't love me like you,
No,
my friends won't love me like you,
Oh my friends will never love me like you"
She played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said,
""Baby,
I just want to dance"" I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar,
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar,
She asked me what does it mean,
the Gaelic ink on your arm?,
Said it was one of my friend's songs,
do you want to drink on?,
She took Jamie as a chaser,
Jack for the fun,
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun,
Chatted some more,
one more drink at the bar,
Then put Van on the jukebox,
got up to dance You know,
she played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said,
""Baby,
I just want to dance"",
With my pretty little Galway Girl,
You're my pretty little Galway Girl You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool,
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room,
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool,
After dancing to Ceilidh singing to trad tunes,
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sang so sweet,
A capella in the bar using her feet for a beat,
Oh,
I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week,
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me You know,
she played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,
Said,
""Baby,
I just want to dance"",

I was holding her hand,
her hand was holding mine,
Our coats both smell of smoke,
whisky and wine,
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night,
I walked her home then she took me inside,
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine,
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write,
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night She played the fiddle in an Irish band,
But she fell in love with an English man,
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand,

Give me love like her,
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone,
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt,

Maybe tonight I'll call ya,
After my blood turns into alcohol,

Smoke alarm went off at 9,
I woke up,
wiped the sleep out of my eye,
She left a note: ""I'll be back in 5"",
Well,
I'm still waiting for that moment to arrive,
hey I was told to put my job in front of you But it won't hold me like you do But I do it for the love,
waiting on the gold rush,
Keep it on the edge,
smoking on a roll-up When I see my friends,
all they say is ""hold up,
And remember the time,
When we were in school listening to grown-ups,
Didn't learn a thing,
but then again you know what? You know how to sing,
But you don't know anything other than that,
So maybe you should learn to love her,

The way she dances slightly out of time And pretends she knows the words,
To a song she's never heard But I tell her all the time,

My mind is a warrior,
My heart is a foreigner,
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset,
I'll never keep it bottled up,
And left to the hands of the coroner,
Be a true heart,
not a follower,
We're not done yet And I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
I'll never let you down,
And I'm keeping on the down low,
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down. You're strumming on my heart strings,
Like you were a grade eight,
But I never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground,
And never ever let you down,
now,
You're strumming on my heart strings,
Like you were a grade eight,
But I never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground,
And never ever let you down,
now My eyes are a river filler,
This drink is a liver killer,
My chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest again,
Your body is my ballpoint pen,
And your mind is my new best friend,
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again,
now And I see it in your movements tonight,
If we should ever do this right,
I'm never gonna let you down,
I'll never let you down,
I'll keep it on the down low,
And I'll keep you around so I'll know,
That I'll never let you down,
I'll never let you down You're strumming on my heart strings,
Like you were a grade eight,
But I never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground,
And never ever let you down,
You're strumming on my heart strings,
Like you were a grade eight,
But I never felt this way,
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground,
And never ever let you down Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now,

And I'll never let you down,

He rode through the streets of the city,
Down from his hill on high,
O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles,
He rode to a woman's side,
For she was his secret treasure,
She was his shame and his bliss,
And a chain and a keep are nothing,
Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm. And there he stood with sword in hand,
The last of Derry's ten,
And red the grass beneath his feet,
And red his banners bright,
And red the blow of the setting sun,
That bathed him in its light,
C'mon c'mon the great lord called,
My sword is hungry still. And with the cry of savage rage,
They swarmed across the rill,
And with the cry of savage rage,
They swarmed across the rill. He rode through the streets of the city,,
Down from his hill on high,,
O'er the winds and the steps and the cobbles,
He rode to a woman's side,,
For she was his secret treasure,
She was his shame and his bliss,
And a chain and a keep are nothing,
Compared to a woman's kiss. For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,
For hands of gold are always cold,
But a woman's hands are warm,

But a woman's hands are warm"
Walking down 29th and park,
I saw you in another's arms,
Only a month we've been apart,
You look happier Saw you walk inside a bar,
He said something to make you laugh,
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours,
Yeah,
you look happier,
you do Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you,
But ain't nobody love you like I do,
Promise that I will not take it personal,
baby,
If you're moving on with someone new 'Cause baby you look happier,
you do,
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too,
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth,
But I know I was happier with you Sat on the corner of the room,
Everything's reminding me of you,
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself you're happier,
Aren't you? Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you,
But ain't nobody need you like I do,
I know that there's others that deserve you,
But my darling,
I am still in love with you But I guess you look happier,
you do,
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too,
I could try to smile to hide the truth,
But I know I was happier with you Baby,
you look happier,
you do,
I know one day you'd fall for someone new,
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do,
Just know that I'll be waiting here for you"
She is the sweetest thing that I know,
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low,
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time,
Took my heart upon a one way trip,
Guess she went wandering off with it,
None like most women I know,
This one will bring it back whole,
Daisies,
daisies perched upon your forehead,
Oh my baby,
lately I know That every night I'll kiss you,
you'll say in my ear,
Oh we're in love,
aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs,
baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
Yeah-yeah,
yeah-yeah She is the river flowin' nowhere,
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells,
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs,
Spend my summertime beside her,
And the rest of the year the same,
She is the flint that sparks the lighter,
And the fuel that will hold the flame,
oh,
Roses,
roses laid upon your bed spread,
oh my,
All this,
all this I know But every night I'll kiss you,
you'll say in my ear,
Oh we're in love,
aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs,
baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,
Oh yeah,
yeah,
yeah,
Yeah-yeah,
yeah-yeah Well,
I've found love inside,
The arms of the woman I know,
She is the lighthouse in the night,
That will safely guide me home,
And I'm not scared of passing over,
Or the thought growing old,
'Cause from now until I go Every night I kiss you,
you'll say in my ear,
Oh we're in love,
aren't we?,
Hands in your hair,
Fingers and thumbs,
baby,
I feel safe when you're holding me near,
Love the way that you conquer your fear,
You know hearts don't break around here,

It's alright to cry,
Even my dad does sometimes,
So don't wipe your eyes,
Tears can remind you of life It's alright to die,
If that's the only thing you haven't tried,
But just for tonight,
hold on So live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart It's alright to shake,
even my hand does sometimes,
So inside we'll rage,
Against the dying of the light It's alright to say,
that that's the only thing you've ever tried,
But just for today,
Hold On So live life like you're giving up,
Cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart,
Hold on Live life like you're giving up,
cause you act like you are,
Go ahead and just live it up,
Go on and tear me apart,
and hold on"
Could I wake up next to you,
When we're hitting double figures,
Look into your eyes,
Like I'm looking into double mirrors,
Could you make it any clearer,
Everything's such a blur,
It's not my turn,
It's hers to get hurt,
On a late night,
Coming home from way too many train rides,
Lace not as red as my face,
I'm home at the same time,
Highbury estate's fine,
Smoking like a dragon,
but don't chase lines I haven't slept for the past week,
Two hours ain't enough for me,
I feel inspired,
at quarter to three,
am,
I haven't changed since our last meet,
I'm still getting all my meals for free,
Think I'm being shunned by my feet,
again It's not a homeless life for me,
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me. And now I'm sitting on a night bus,
Flicking through my Ipod,
Feeling kinda tired,
So I try to close my eyes up,
Driver,
turn the lights off,
Lights on,
on stage,
mics on Song plays,
nice one,
Gotta keep my hype strong,
Truth be,
never went to Uni,
People see right through me,
But I'm not a fool see,
I'm never gonna do one,
Gonna live past 22,
done,
Everything I need to,
Except get a 2: 1 I haven't slept for the past week,
Two hours ain't enough for me,
I feel inspired,
at quarter to three,
am,
I haven't changed since our last meet,
I'm still getting all my meal's for free,
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again It's not a homeless life for me,
it's just I'm home less than I'd like to be It's not a homeless life for me When I feel cold,
You keep me warm,
And I'm not looking for some loose change,
Wanna find a true mate,
Who wants to be my duvet,
It's not a homeless life for me,
it's just I'm home less than I'd like to be And it's not a homeless life for me,
yearh,
mh,
oh."
You are the one,
girl,
And you know that it's true,
I'm feeling younger,
Every time that I'm alone with you We were sitting in a parked car,
Stealing kisses in a front yard,
We got questions we should not ask,
but How would you feel,
If I told you I loved you,
It's just something that I want to do,
I'll be taking my time,
Spending my life,
Falling deeper in love with you,
So tell me that you love me too In the summer,
As the lilacs bloom,
Blood flows deeper than a river,
Every moment that I spend with you We were sat upon our best friend's roof,
I had both of my arms around you,
Watching the sunrise replace the moon,
but How would you feel,
If I told you I loved you,
It's just something that I want to do,
I'll be taking my time,
Spending my life,
Falling deeper in love with you,
So tell me that you love me too Yeah,
we were sitting in a parked car,
Stealing kisses in a front yard,
We got questions we should not ask How would you feel,
If I told you I loved you,
It's just something that I want to do,
I'll be taking my time,
Spending my life,
Falling deeper in love with you,
Tell me that you love me too,
Tell me that you love me too,
Tell me that you love me too"

And with that shadow upon the ground,
I hear my people screaming out.,
Now I see fire,
Inside the mountain,
I see fire,
Burning the trees,
And I see fire,
Hollowing souls,
And I see fire,
Blood in the breeze.,
I see fire (Oh you know I saw a city burning) (fire),
And I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin,
yeah) (fire),
And I see fire (Uh-uh-uh-uh) (fire),
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side."
I stole a car last night,
don't know where we're gonna go,
but go ahead and drive I will take you home,
Honey it's cold outside,
(Mmm) your jumper is torn now,
but darling hold on tight I will keep you warm,
And we will cry till this fire is drowned,
And we will write all our memories down,
And we will drive till these tires wear out,
But darling I,
I will take you home -- Instrumental --,
If we can drive all night,
Until the sun is showing up,
I see it in your eyes Mmm... they will take me home,
Honey,
it's so damn bright,
Daylight's taking over again,
Just follow the signs (ooh ooh) they will lead us home,
And we will cry,
'Til this fire is drowned And we will write all our memories down,
and we will drive till these tires wear out,
But darling I,
I will take you home,
And we will drive 'til our tires wear out,
And we will write all our memories down,
And we will cry 'til this fire is drowned,
but darling,
I,
I will keep you warm,
oh darling,
I,
I will keep you warm,
(and) darling I,
I will take you home"
Oh,
I'm a mess right now,
Inside out,
Searching for a sweet surrender,
But this is not the end I can't work it out,
How going through the motions,
Going through us And oh I've known it for the longest time,
And all of my hopes,
All of my own words,
Are all over written on the signs,
But you're on my road,
Walking me home,
home,
home,
home,
home See the flames inside my eyes,
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love,
no,
Easy baby maybe I'm a liar,
But for tonight I wanna fall in love,
And put your faith in my stomach I messed up this time,
Late last night,
Drinking to suppress devotion,
With fingers intertwined I can't shake this feeling now,
We're going through the motions,
Hoping you'd stop And oh I've only caused you pain,
I know but all of my words will always below,
Of all the love you spoke,
When you're on my road,
Walking me home,
home,
home,
home,
home See the flames inside my eyes,
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love,
no,
Easy,
baby,
maybe I'm a liar,
But for tonight I wanna fall in love,
And put your faith in my stomach And for how long I love my lover,
For how long I love my lover and now,
now,
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(And I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long,
long I love my lover now,
now,
(I feel it all over now,
now and I feel love),
For how long I love my lover now,
now,
For how long,
long I love my lover"
It's been a while since we were here,
Been too long my fear is,
Holding back the memories of your eyes,
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left me,
All that's left is shattered hearts,
It's plain enough for us to see that,
You've got me,
You've got me We're just friends tangled up in loose ends,
I feel it coming around again,
Let me know where you let your heart go,
And I will just pretend,
That I have never felt this way,
Since you I have never felt this way,
Since you,
I feel strange,
Playing games,
It's no fuss,
I'm not in love Twisted tunes,
a melody of spite,
If you give me the words then I might,
Let go unknown feelings,
Telling me that I cannot fight,
When you speak that shite,
Let go unknown feelings,
Telling me that,
You've got me,
You've got me We're just friends tangled up in loose ends,
I feel it coming around again,
Let me know where you let your heart go,
And I will just pretend,
That I have never felt this way,
Since you I have never felt this way,
Since you,
I feel strange,
Playing games,
It's no fuss,
I'm not in love I lost it in your kiss,
your lips,,
Sweetness,
in your smile,
Your words make me whole,
But your scars demand a healer's touch,
It's true,
I'm glad I'm not you"
I write this song in memory of,
The wayward smile,
The boy we won't forget,
The soul you took away from us,
The river flows,
The tears that we wept Missing you,
Is all that needs to be said,
More than blue,
The words inside my head And I know that you're gone The cheeky smile,
Of jokes and laughs,
The memories of times,
We crossed the line,
The stepping stones,
Across my mind,
Washed away,
We all now feel so blind Missing you,
Is all that needs to be said,
More than blue,
The words inside my head And I know that you're gone Goodbye"
I'm getting very edgy,
Cos you're trying to take this from me,
And it's something that I wanted so bad,
Cos you're the definition,
Of someone who has to ruin,
The best thing that I ever had,
Cos you're a jealous girl,
And all I can say is,
It's your fault but partially mine,
For losing hope,
For not treating you right,
But that will disappear in time All I gotta do is pass you by,
Never say what's wrong,
Whenever I say why? Standing in the corner,
Shadowed by the light,
To you I seem much smaller,
But I know it might be you,
How much better could I do,
To be myself,
not someone else?,
I'm losing sleep,
I live only for the week I've grown to ignore you,
Cos when I seem to bore you,
You pretend that you're not interested,
Your eyes start to twinkle,
Your smile starts to widen,
And I just seem to try and forget,
But you pay me no attention,
Even though I do,
But I don't care as long as you're mine,
It's happening every time All I gotta do is pass you by,
Never say what's wrong,
Whenever I say why? Standing in the corner,
Shadowed by the light,
To you I seem much smaller,
But I know it might be you,
How much better could I do,
To be myself,
not someone else?,
I'm losing sleep,
I live only for the week And I'm falling harder now it seems,
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams,
And I can't sleep although I think I can,
It's insomnia I think I have,
But who cares when I'm not your man? Standing in the corner,
Shadowed by the light,
To you I seem much smaller,
But I know it might be you,
How much better could I do,
To be myself,
not someone else?,
I'm losing sleep,
I live only for the week"
Settle down with me,
Cover me up,
Cuddle me in Lie down with me,
yeah,
And hold me in your arms And your heart's against my chest,
Your lips pressed to my neck,
I'm falling for your eyes,
But they don't know me yet And with a feeling I'll forget,
I'm in love now Kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love Settle down with me,
And I'll be your safety,
You'll be my lady I was made to keep your body warm,
But I'm cold as the wind blows so hold me in your arms My heart's against your chest,
Your lips pressed to my neck,
I'm falling for your eyes,
But they don't know me yet And with this feeling I'll forget,,
I'm in love now Kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love Yeah I've been feeling everything,
From hate to love,
From love to lust,
From lust to truth,
I guess that's how I know you,
So I hold you close to help you give it up So kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love Kiss me like you wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
You wanna be loved,
This feels like falling in love,
Falling in love,
Falling in love"
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be,
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees,
Admiring the scene,
inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe.,
Jet-lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep,
Although my blood shot whites and irises they never find any,
Clock stops at times where the sunshine can blind many,
Although my eyes are heavy,
they won't be closing soon,
'Cause I heard that time waits for nobody,
I suppose it's true,
We make corrosive tunes through acid tabs and vocables,
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots,
we make our motive moves I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme,
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine,
""'Cause real will recognise real"" is what my father says,
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away,
Overworking,
no sleep is just another way to die slow But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close. 5 o'clock with lights off,
Interview with a vampire,
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require,
I swear I said,
that I'll sleep when I'm dead,
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed,
it's D-E-V to the Z,
Overtired,
pale-faced like Michael Myers,
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired,
And over the time within this maze I'll think you'll find you'll never find that piece of mind you seek to find until your dying,
'Cause I got too much to stay awake for,
to sleep or even take 4,
seconds out the game,
It's time to wage war,
Scissors,
grab a sword,
and sharpen up your hunting knives,
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight,
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line,
Villains never sleep the mastermind in all sorts of crimes,,
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines Or get left mortified like you've just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by,
I never sleep When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free,
it could be,
The times I'm living in I never sleep,
when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free,
it could be...,
The times I'm living in lately. I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out,
Deliver the raps how I flow,
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me Ron,
But they won't Slytherin too easy,
believe me I'm Snape minded,
Be within this great time,
be on minimum wage,
life is a prison escape that I'm in,
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with,
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in,
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows,
Some of the the songs I write are real because the chart is filled with si-lo-con,
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro,
living out of three bags no talk About my cash flow,
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework,
Which has got me on the sofa,
no degree but growing older,
I played a fool to catch the wise I will never tell a lie,
Await death,
take deep breaths,
try to never die.,
Never die.,
2 guys with the same view,
keep it tight like screws,
Making metaphors flow and move,
like typhoons and tunes,
And if we got our eyes on you,
we'll catch you while you snooze,,
Times elapsing while your catching Z's,
the masses like to move,
We scan the situation,
analyse information,
and then decide what probably is most Practical to do,,
Driven young gentlemen,
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months 'causeI haven't Slept in them,
true!,
I'm coming home,
the lights are on,
your rights are wrong so I'm correcting 'em,
We got the fans all like 'Oh wow it's Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect From 'em,
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment,
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever Waste a second of the time I got,,
I keep my pupils engaged,,
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but I'm only trying to stay awake.,
I never sleep,
When trouble steals thoughts from my restless mind for free,
it could be,,
The times I'm living in I never sleep,
when trouble steals thoughts from my restless Mind for free,
it could be... The times I'm living in lately."

I'm gonna pick up the pieces,
And build a Lego house,
If things go wrong we can knock it down My three words have two meanings,
There's one thing on my mind,
It's all for you And it's dark in a cold December,,
But I've got you to keep me warm,
If you're broken I will mend you,
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of sight,
I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now,
now I'm gonna paint you by numbers,
And color you in,
If things go right we can frame it,
And put you on a wall And it's so hard to say it,
But I've been here before,
Now I'll surrender up my heart,
And swap it for yours I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of sight,
I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now Don't hold me down,
I think the braces are breaking,,
And it's more than I can take And it's dark in a cold December,,
But I've got you to keep me warm,
If you're broken I will mend you,
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of sight,
I'm out of mind,
I'll do it all for you in time,
And out of all these things I've done,
I think I love you better now I'm out of touch,
I'm out of love,
I'll pick you up when you're getting down,
And out of all these things I've done,
I will love you better now"
You give me life,
Like a loss of oxygen,
You treat me like,
I was in love again,
And I hold you tight,
Tight enough to know,
That you are mine,
I'd never let you go And it's you I miss,
And it's you I miss,
So let it out,
Let it out,
now,
I let it out,
I let it out now,
now You speak to me,
Behind your darkening stare,
And you've let me be,
As if I wasn't there,
It seemed perfect,
the concept,
free from any regret,
Another couple based on teen sex,
You idiot,
true I was just like you,
We couldn't be torn apart,
You see we were just like glue It's you I miss And it's you I miss,
So let it out,
Let it out,

If we take this bird in,
with its broken leg,
We could nurse it,
she said,
Come in side for a little lie down with me,
And if we fall asleep it would be the worst thing.,
But when i wake up,
and your makeup is on my shoulder,
And tell me if i lie down,
would you stay now?,
Let me hold ya,
ohh But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how i miss you,

And its not complete yet,

Cause that leads to regret,

And i'll owe it all to you,
oh,

in the morning dew,
We can lay down,
so i'm next you,
Come inside for a little home made tea,
And if you fall asleep,
then at least your next to me,
And if i wake up,

I'm covered by nature and i'm safe now,
Underneath this oak tree,
with you beside me But if i kiss you will your mouth read this truth,
Darling how i miss you,

When the sins of my father,
Weigh down in my soul,
And the pain of my mother,
Will not let me go Well I know there can come fire from the sky,
To refine the purest of kings,
And even though,
I know this fire brings me pain,
Even so,
And just the same Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Oh,
make it rain,
Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Make it rain Oh,
the seed needs the water,
Before it grows out of the ground,
But it just keeps on getting hotter,
And the hunger more profound Well I know there can come tears from the eye,
But they may as well all be in vain,
And even though,
I know these tears come with pain,
Even so,
And just the same Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Oh,
make it rain,
Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Just make it rain,
Make it rain Oh,
the seas are full of water,
That stops by the shore,
Just like the riches of grandeur,
Oh,
no no,
Never reach the poor And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause,
And let lightning be the veins,
And fill the sky,
with all that they can draw,
When it's time to make a change Make it rain,
Make it rain down,
Lord,
Make it rain,
Make it rain,
Make it rain,

Well,
I've walked this street before,
And everyone's locked up their door,
'Cause they heard me coming,
And I've been running,
From what,
I don't know if she's there,
Or if she's cares,
It's taken you a long time to see,
You've got a goldfish memory,
This song's for you,
not for me,
In misery,
It's taken you a long time to see,
You've got a goldfish memory,
This song's for you,
not for me,
In misery,
You said we went too fast,
And you said we wouldn't last,
Now I've put the past behind me,
And I'm running,
From what,
I don't know if she's there,
Or if she cares,
It's taken you a long time to see,
You've got a goldfish memory,
This song's for you,
not for me,
In misery,

Yeah,

Yeah,

Yeah,

It's taken you a long time to see,
It's taken you a long time to see,
In misery"
Shock,
horror,
I'm down,
Lost,
you're not around,
There's a lump in my chest,
That sends cold through my head,
And my mind shuts sound out,
I'm on auto-pilot,
And my tongue's gone silent,
Just switch it off and lay it down,
Lay it down next to me I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,
you said,
you said,
That I miss you,
And I miss you These words mean nothing to me,
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be,
These three words are aching,
Constrict them,
suffocating,
My mind is racing,
With the picture I'm painting,
And my belly's sick to its stomach,
When I remember all the times it was with you when you laid it down,
You lay down next to me I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,
you said,
you said,
That I miss you More than I let on,
I kissed you,
Far too long,
I'll let go as soon as you do,
See I know we're not through I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe when I made you mine,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,
you said,
you said,
That I miss you,
that I miss you,
Whoa-oh-oh-oh,
I don't know when I lost my mind,
Maybe it was every time,
That you said,
you said,
you said,
That I miss you"
Come on now,
Dry your eyes,
I'm sick of all your lies,
I've grown to despise you,
Already sick of what you're saying,
Hoping now I'm only praying,
My baby's gone away,
And I've already packed my bags You didn't know me (I've run away),
You couldn't show me,
(What you have to say),
My one and only Has gone away,
Far away,
You'll never leave me alone,
Now I'm off on my own,
I'll never ring your phone again,
And still you keep on crying,
If I said I loved you,
I'd be lying,
You need to dry your eyes And I've still gone to pack my bags You didn't know me,
(I've run away),
You couldn't show me,
(What you have to say) My one and only,
Has gone away,
You didn't know me,
(I've run away),
You couldn't show me,
(What you have to say),
My one and only,
Has gone away,
Far away"
Now it seems I've been young,
dug my hole in the ground,
To me there's only up,
there ain't no point in looking down,
However hard I try,
I only get weaker,
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold What you gotta do is never get yourself down,
Bastards do that for you,
get you deeper in the ground,
Keep out of trouble,
ain't no trouble being pure,
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now Move on,
forget it,
Now move on,
forget it When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters,
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar,
And made for the stars,
kept my grind in the dark,
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody,
Hennesey shots and glocks,
all these fools on the block,
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?,
I'm just a normal,
casual,
usual,
everyday type of guy,
With my head in the sky,
Ed Sheeran,
Urban Angel coming ready to die,
So see the signs,
stand to the side,
Open your eyes and take a look and realise,
The resurrection's arrived,
And as the mist clears,
homie I arise,
From my tomb in disguise,
I'm all alone,
Alonestar,
Urban Angel rising from the ashes,
Surprising all haters,
guiding,
advising them all to steady move,
Now back up! Move on,
forget it,
Now move on,
forget it All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it,
Not to abuse it and get affected,
infected with the who's who of music,
Who did it,
who is it,
who's in it,
who... what the fuck does it matter?,
Chitter chatter,
don't matter,
yidder,
yidder,
yadder,
It don't matter to me,
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely,
To be me in this seedy,
needy world,
can you hear me?,
Yeah,
yeah,
can you hear me?"
I was twenty-four years old,
When I met the woman I would call my own,
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old,
In that house that your brother bought ya,
Oh the summer day when I proposed,
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold,
And I asked her father,
but her daddy said,
""No,
You can't marry my daughter"" She and I went on the run,
Don't care about religion,
I'm gonna marry the woman I love,
Down by the Wexford border,
She was Nancy Mulligan,
And I was William Sheeran,
She took my name and then we were one,
Down by the Wexford border Well,
met her at Guy's in the second world war,
And she was working on a soldier's ward,
Never had I seen such beauty before,
The moment that I saw her,
Nancy was my yellow rose,
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes,
We got eight children now growing old,
Five sons and three daughters She and I went on the run,
Don't care about religion,
I'm gonna marry the woman I love,
Down by the Wexford border,
She was Nancy Mulligan,
And I was William Sheeran,
She took my name and then we were one,
Down by the Wexford border From her snow white streak in her jet black hair,
Over sixteen years I've been loving her,
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs,
You know Nancy,
I adore ya,
From a farm boy born near Belfast town,
I never worried about the king and crown,
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground,
There's no difference,
I ensure ya She and I went on the run,
Don't care about religion,
I'm gonna marry the woman I love,
Down by the Wexford border,
She was Nancy Mulligan,
And I was William Sheeran,
She took my name and then we were one,
Down by the Wexford border"
No,
no,
no,
no,
no I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans,
Goes to the gym at least six times a week,
Wears both shoes with no socks on his feet,
And I hear he's on a new diet at watches what he eats,
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his asshole bleached,
Owns every single Ministry CD,
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means,
But I heard he makes you happy,
so that's fine by me,
But still,
I'm just keepin' it real,
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil',
I'll be tryin' not to double tap,
from way back,
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at,
Let me remind you of the days when,
You used to hold my hand,
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans,
I guess if you were Lois Lane,
I wasn't Superman,
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved,
So let me give it to ya I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to,
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,
I don't wanna know about your new man,
We'll get there eventually,
I know you're missing all this kind of love,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me Your new man rents a house in the 'burb,
And wears a man bag on his shoulder,
but I call it a purse,
Every year,
he goes to Malaga with all the fellas,
Drinks beer,
but has a six pack,
I'm kinda jealous,
He wears sunglasses indoors,
in winter,
at nighttime,
And every time a rap song comes on,
he makes a gang sign,
Says,
""Cheya!"",
boy never light up the room,
But enough about him,
girl,
let's talk about you,
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water reading,
Eatin' a packet of the crisp,
but you will never find you cheating,
Now you're eating kale,
hitting the gym,
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim,
In the back of the club,
kissing a boy that ain't him,
Okay,
you need to be alone,
And if you wanna talk about it,
you can call my phone,
I just thought I would tell you,
'cause you oughta know,
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved,
So let me give it to ya I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to,
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,
I don't wanna know about your new man,
We'll get there eventually,
I know you're missing all this kind of love,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me Baby,
I'm not trying to ruin your week,
But you act so differently,
When you're with him,
I know you're lonely,
Please remember you're still free,
To make the choice and leave,
Don't call me up,
you need to show me I don't wanna know about your new man,
'Cause if it was meant to be,
You wouldn't be calling me up trying to,
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me,
I don't wanna know about your new man,
We'll get there eventually,
I know you're missing all this kind of love,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about,
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about,
I don't wanna know about your new man"
Five drinks in on Friday night,
We only came to dry your eyes,
And get you out of your room Now this bar has closed it's doors,
I found my hand is holding yours,
Do you wanna go home so soon?,
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night,
And sing along to every song that's on the radio,
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn,
Oh no no,
the sun could rise,
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM,
So DJ,
play it again Until the night turns into morning,
You'll be in my arms,
We'll just keep driving,
Along the boulevard,
And if I kissed you,
darling,
Please don't be alarmed,
It's just the start,
Of everything if you want,
A new love,
In New York Yesterday,
you gave me a call,
Stressing out about it all,
Said the world is moving too fast,
And you don't know where to begin,
Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in,
Only to wind up on the other side,
By yourself,
And every day,
Screaming out,
To all the people that you used to know,
From a window that looks upon the Manhattan skyline,
It's just the way that life goes,
And you live it in every song you know,
So DJ,
play it again Until the night turns into morning,
You'll be in my arms,
We'll just keep driving,
Along the boulevard,
And if I kissed you,
darling,
Please don't be alarmed,
It's just the start,
Of everything if you want,
A new life,
In New York And every song that plays,
Is just like the day you had,
And it's okay to cry,
But I'm saying maybe that's,
A waste of water,
You know I'm here for you,
In the back of the taxi cab tonight,
In New York It's just reached the morning,
And you're still in my arms,
And we've stopped driving,
Down the boulevard,
And I just kissed you,
darling,
I hope you weren't alarmed,
It's just the start,
Of everything that you want,
A new love,
In New York"
I met you when I was a teen,
But then you were one as well,
And I could play a guitar,
Just like ringing a bell,
Sometimes I wonder,,
In any other summer,
Could you be a part time lover to me,
Listening to Stevie Wonder?,
Under the covers where we used to lay,
And re stacks is what the speakers played,
I'd be on tour almost every day When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay Just watching a dvd,
smoking illegal weed,
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breath,
We'd use each other's air just for the people to see,
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep,
We'd go anywhere our minds would take us,
And I'd say you were beautiful without your make up,
And you don't need even to worry about your weight cause We can all be loved the way that god made us,
And time's the only reason that we could break up Cause you would always tell me I was away too much Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane or make a mistake So say it again Oh Nina,
you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina,
But then again you should know Nina Cause that's you and me both Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie,
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold,
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own,
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone Watching blue planet,
creating new habits,
Acting as if we was two rabbits,
And then you'd vanish Back to the burrow with all the Celtics,
I'd disappear,
you'd call me selfish,
I understand but I can't help I put my job over everything except my family and friends,
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back,
Overlook the situation cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications And I'm not saying we should be taking a break,
Just revaluate quick before we make a mistake and it's too late,
So we can either deal with pain and wait to get on a plane,
But in a day we'd have to say it again Oh Nina,
you should go Nina Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? And I've been living on the road Nina,
But then again you should know Nina,
Cause that's you and me both Nina,
Oh won't you leave me now? Love will come and love will go,
But you can't make it on your own Sing that song,
Go oh won't you leave me now?,
People grow and fall apart,
But you can't mend your broken heart,
Take it back,
Go oh won't you leave me now?,
Ooh Oh Nina,
you should go Nina,
(Love will come and love will go,
but you can't make it on your own),
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
(Sing that song),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
And I've been living on the road Nina,
oh (People grow and fall apart),
But then again you should know Nina,
(But you can't mend your broken heart),
Cause that's you and me both Nina,
(Take it back),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
Now? Oh Nina,
you should go Nina,
(Love will come and love will go,
but you can't make it on your own),
Cause I ain't ever coming home Nina,
(Sing that song),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
And I've been living on the road Nina (I've been living on the road),
(People grow and fall apart),
But then again you should know Nina (then again you should know),
(But you can't mend your broken heart),
Cause that's you and me both Nina (cause that's you and me both),
(Take it back),
Oh won't you leave me now?,
(Go oh won't you leave me now?),
Now?"
Tell me that you'd turn down the man,
Who askes for your hand,
'Cause you're waiting for me,
And I know,
You're gonna be away a while,
But I've got no plans at all to leave Would you take away my hopes and dreams,
And just stay with me? All my senses come to life,
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I,
Have ever been and I'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one,
And all my friends have gone to find,
Another place to let their hearts collide,
Just promise me,
you'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one Take my hand and my,
Heart and soul,
I will,
Only have these eyes for you,
And you know,,
Everything changes but,
We'll be strangers if we see this through We could stay within these walls and bleed,
Or just stay with me? All my senses come to life,
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I,
Have ever been and I'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one,
And all my friends have gone to find,
Another place to let their hearts collide,
Just promise me,
you'll always be a friend,
'Cause you are the only one Stumbling half drunk,
Getting myself lost,
I am so gone,
So tell me the way home,
I listen to sad songs,
Singing about love,
And where it goes wrong All my senses come to life,
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I,
Have ever been and I'll never leave again,
'Cause you are the only one,
And all my friends have gone to find,
Another place to let their hearts collide,
Just promise me,
you'll always be a friend,
'Cause you are the only one"
Lying in a bedroom,
Lighting up a Benson,
Face hair is growing,
So I cut with a vengeance,
Hey,
did I mention,
As she makes an entrance,
Said I had a tendency,
To finish off a sentence,
Oh well,
she's a local girl,
No make-up 'cause she knows me well,
Hair tied up in elastic band,
With a kiss on the cheek,
For her one-night man,
Is it fast food,
I'll regret it after?,
And I needed money,
But I'm too shy to ask her,
So she buys me chips and cheese,
And I tell her I love her,
And she's all I need,
I take it with a cold glass,
Of the fruit and the barley,
She's still a sucker,
For the apple and Bacardi,
Heading to the party,
Sitting in the car seat,
B.E.P. on radio,
It makes me feel naughty,
She knows me well,
Bit of a catch to have a local girl,
Hair tied up in elastic band,
With a kiss on the cheek,
For her one-night man,
I don't wanna go alone,
I don't wanna go alone,
I don't wanna go alone,
Tell her that I love her,
Tell her that I need her,
Tell her that she's more,
Than a one-night stand,
Tell her that she turns my cheeks,
The color of my hair,
All I wanna do is be near,
Tell her that I want her,
Tell her that I need her,
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand,
Tell her that I love her,
More than anyone else,
If you don't,
I'll tell her myself,
And we've got love in us,
So if the drink kill us,
We're gonna dance all night,
'Til the floor fillers,
If we talk outside,
I say I hate wasps too,
I don't really dance,
So I'll just watch you,
Are you taking me back tonight?,
Tell me if that's alright,
I don't wanna be here,
I'm not the sofa type,
Tell me if you have a toothbrush,
You don't mind sharing,
She said I wanna take off,
What you're wearing,
I don't wanna go alone,
I don't wanna go alone,
I don't wanna go alone,
Tell her that I love her,
Tell her that I need her,
Tell her that she's more,
Than a one-night stand,
Tell her that she turns my cheeks,
The color of my hair,
All I wanna do is be near,
Tell her that I want her,
Tell her that I need her,
Tell her that she's more,
Than a one-night stand,
Tell her that I love her,
More than anyone else,
If you don't,
I'll tell her myself,
She's like the fast food,
I'll regret it after,
And I needed money,
But I'm too shy to ask her,
But she buys me chips and cheese,
So I tell her that she's all I need,
Tell her that I,
Tell her that I,
Tell her that she's more,
Than a one-night stand,
Tell her that she turns my cheeks,
The color of my hair,
All I wanna do is be near,
Tell her that I,
Tell her that I,
Tell her that she's more,
Than a one-night stand,
Tell her that I love her,
More than anyone else,
If you don't,
I'll tell her myself,
Tell her that I love her,
Tell her that I need her,
That she's more,
Than a one-night stand,
Tell her that she turns my cheeks,
The color of my hair,
All I wanna do is be near,
Tell her that I want her,
Tell her that I need her,
Tell her that she's more,
Than a one-night stand,
Tell her that I love her,
More than anyone else,
If you don't,
I'll tell her myself"
Can't get you off my mind,
Look at me and you will find,
Time after time it seems,
I'll say what I don't mean In your world we were the same,
In mine now you're the one to blame,
You can't remember my name,
We're lost,
it's such a shame Listen to me,
Stop making me see,
What I've been waiting for,
Listen to me,
Stop making me see I'm strong yet proud,
I'm quiet yet loud,
And I'm everything,
You want in me,
I'm small yet tall,
I have it all,
And I'm everything,
You want me to be Listen to me,
Stop making me see,
What I've been waiting for,
Listen to me,
Stop making me see And I still feel like,
I need you still,
And I still feel like,
I'm on some pill,
And I still feel like,
I need you still Listen to me,
Stop making me see,
What I've been waiting for,
Listen to me,
Making me see"
Of all the money that e'er I had,
I've spent it in good company,
And all the harm that e'er I've done,
alas,
it was to none but me,
And all I've done for want of wit,
to memory now I can't recall,
So fill to me the parting glass,
good night and joy be with you all Of all the comrades that e'er I had,
they are sorry for my going away,
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had,
they would wish me one more day to stay,
But since it falls unto my lord that I should rise and you should not,
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call Good night and joy be with you all,
A man may drink and not be drunk,
a man may fight and not be slain,
A man may court a pretty girl and perhaps be welcomed back again But since it has so ordered been by a time to rise and a time to fall,
Come fill to me the parting glass,
good night and joy be with you all,
Come fill to me the parting glass,
good night and joy be with you all"
I found a love for me,
Darling,

Well,

Fighting against all odds,
I know we'll be alright this time,

Be my girl,

darling,
you look perfect tonight Sei la mia donna,
la forza delle onde del mare,
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti e molto di piu,
Spero che un giorno,
l'amore che ci ha accompagnato,
Diventi casa,
la mia famiglia,
diventi noi E siamo sempre bambini ma nulla e impossibile,
Stavolta non ti lascero,
Mi baci piano ed io torno ad esistere,
E nel tuo sguardo crescero Ballo con te,
nell'oscurita,
stretti forte poi,
A piedi nudi noi,
dentro la nostra musica,
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto:,
""Tu stasera,
vedi,
sei perfetta per me"" Ballo con te,
nell'oscurita,
stretti forte poi,
A piedi nudi noi,
dentro la nostra musica,
Ho creduto sempre in noi,
Perche sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato Quanto ti ho aspettato,
Perche tu stasera sei perfetta per me"
Loving can hurt,
Loving can hurt sometimes,
But it's the only thing,
That I know. And when it gets hard,
You know it can get hard sometimes,
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive. We keep this love in a photograph,
We make these memories for ourselves,
Where our eyes are never closing,
Hearts are never broken,
And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me,
Inside the pocket,
Of your ripped jeans,
Holdin' me closer,
Till our eyes meet,
You won't ever be alone,
Wait for me to come home. Loving can heal,
Loving can mend your soul,
And is the only thing,
That I know (know),
I swear it will get easier,
Remember that with every piece of ya,
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die. We keep this love in a photograph,
We make these memories for ourselves,
Where our eyes are never closing,
Our hearts were never broken,
And time's forever frozen still. So you can keep me,
Inside the pocket,
Of your ripped jeans,
Holdin' me closer,
Till our eyes meet,
You won't ever be alone. And if you hurt me,
Well that's okay baby only words bleed,
Inside these pages you just hold me,
And I won't ever let you go. Wait for me to come home,
Wait for me to come home,
Wait for me to come home,
Wait for me to come home. Oh you can fit me,
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16,
Next to your heartbeat,
Where I should be,
Keep it deep within your soul. And if you hurt me,
Well that's okay baby only words bleed,
Inside these pages you just hold me,
And I won't ever let you go. When I'm away,
I will remember how you kissed me,
Under the lamppost,
Back on 6th street,
Hearing you whisper through the phone,
Wait for me to come home."

In shadow there lies hope,
Cut tension with a knife,
I find it hard to cope,
Stop playing with my life,
You analyse my fears,
Analyse my dreams,
Choke on burning tears,
Through my silent screams Things aren't what they seem Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me,
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe,
Open doors just to take away the key,
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better Watch me fall,
As I stumble at your feet,
Always losing in this game,
Your lies cut me deep,
And you don't even know my name,
With your consistency,
To always make me crawl,
And my durability,
Not affected at all Still things aren't what they seem Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me,
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe,
Open doors just to take away the key,
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better Feel the pain,
On my brain,
Feel the strain,
As I start to decay,
Feel the strain,
Every passing day,
Feel the pain,
As I start to decay Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me,
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe,
Open doors just to take away the key,
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better"
I've known it for a long time,
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine,
Disappearing all night,
I don't wanna know where he's been lying I know what I wanna do,
I wanna runaway,
Runaway with you,
Gonna grab clothes,
socks,
in the morning,
go How long you leaving?,
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening,
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this,
It's been a long day,
Thumb on side of the roadway,
but I love him from the skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows,
I'll just runaway and be on my own I've never seen my dad cry,
Cold as stone,
in the kitchen light,
I tell you it's about time,
But I was raised to keep quiet,
And this is what I'm gonna do,
Gonna runaway,
gonna make that move,
Gonna grab clothes,
and when it's morning,
go How long you leaving?,
Well dad just don't expect me back this evening,
Oh it could take a bit of time to heal this,
It's been a long day,
Thumb on side of the roadway,
but I love him from the skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There's nothing to say and he knows,
I'll just runaway and be on my own Back pack,
and a flat cap,
turned to the back,
Cause I packed my closet,
My dad was a man without plans,
But taking turns to show love,
I don't wanna live this way,
Gonna take my things and go,
If things change in a matter of days,
Could be persuaded to hold up And mama was the same,
None of us are saints,
I guess that god knows that,
I don't wanna runaway,
And one of these days I might just show that,
Put my home in a suitcase,
Tie both showlaces,
and hope that,
Things change,
but for now I leave town with a backpack on my shoulder I love him from the skin to my bones,
But I don't wanna live in his home,
There's nothing to say and he knows,
I'll just runaway and be on my own"
Sara,
what you do is enlighten my mind,
Oh wow,
I said,
Sara,
what you do is make my soul unwind Hey now,
'Cos your hair is blonde,
your eyes are blue,
Half the guys I know are after you,
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood,
So I thought I'd write a song for you And may I say,
you look like an angel today,
May I say,
take me to the place where your mind lays,
If only to make you smile today,
'Cos you are great,
I thought I'd say that Sara,
reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock,
Behind a can of Strongbow,
Oh wow,
I said,
Sara,
you say that you don't look good when you do,
Even with that soul Your hair is blonde,
your eyes are blue,
Half the guys I know are after you,
Cheer me up when I'm in a mood,
So I thought I'd write a song for you And may I say,
you look like an angel today,
May I say,
take me to the place where your mind lays,
If only to make you smile today,
'Cos you are great,
I thought I'd say that May I say,
you look great,
May I play this to make your day"
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe,
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak,
I drove miles and miles,
but would you do the same for me?,
Oh,
honestly?,
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon,
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm,
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song,
It goes on and on Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf,
My farewell,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain,
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or dream,
What line do we stand upon 'cause from here looks the same?,
And only scars remain Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf,
My farewell,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself But if don't,
Then I'll go back,
To where I'm rescuing a stranger,
Just because they needed saving just like that,
Oh,
I'm here again,
Between the devil and the danger,
But I guess it's just my nature,
My dad was wrong,
'Cause I'm not like my mum,
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song,
But it helps,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels,
I drown it with a drink and out of date prescription pills,
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf,
My farewell,
So before I save someone else,
I've got to save myself,
And before I blame someone else,
I've got to save myself,
And before I love someone else,
I've got to love myself"

I paid all my dues,
And she wanted to know,
That I'd never leave her,
Now I'm ready to go As strange as it seems,
She's endless to me,
She's just like paperwork but harder to read,
Patience's my enemy,
Loving's my friend,
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve Than to stay and just pretend,
Oh she,
knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
I made all my plans,
And as she has made hers,
She kept me in mind,
But I wasn't sure,
I searched every room For a way to escape,
But every time I try to leave she keeps holding on to me for dear life,
And blocking my way,
Patience's my enemy Loving's my friend,
It's harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve,
Than to stay and just pretend,
Oh she,
knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
And like the back of her hand she already understands everything ""Won't you stay"" she says,
And she already knows how it goes,
And where she stands I'll stay,
anyway,
'Cause she knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
Oh she,
knows me so well,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
I know myself,
Oh she,
knows me like I know myself,
I know myself,
I know myself,
I know myself"

If you don't swim,
you'll drown,
But don't move,
honey,
You look so perfect standing there,
In my American Apparel underwear,
And I know now,
that I'm so down,
Your lipstick stain is a work of art,
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart And I know now,
that I'm so down (whoa) Hey,

hey Let's get out,

Cause this deadbeat town's only here just to keep us down,
While I was out,
I found myself alone just thinking,
If I showed up with a plane ticket,
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it,
Would you wanna run away too?,
'Cause all I really want is you,
You look so perfect standing there,
In my American Apparel underwear,

I can taste salt water,
And if I blink again,
You'll be sinking in,
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made,
I hold you and you think of him,
And pretty soon you'll be floating away And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of,
Anchored down in my throat,
love,
And I'm captain of this sinking boat,
now,
With just one armband to carry me home When salted tears won't dry,
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves,
Under your eyes,
These hearts will be flooded tonight,
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves,
Under your eyes,
Your eyes,
your eyes,
your eyes,
your eyes,
your eyes I still taste salt water,
On my lips from your kiss: bitterness,
And I drown within the ocean you made,
And I hate to love you,
these cuffs covered in your make up,
I'll never trust you again,
You can just be a friend And I'll hold on to the words you spoke of,
Anchored down in my throat,
love,
And I'm captain of this sinking boat,
now,
With just one armband to carry me home When salted tears won't dry,
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves,
Under your eyes,
These hearts will be flooded tonight,
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves,
Under your eyes Your eyes,
your lips,
your mouth,
Your thighs,
your back,
you drive me wild,
Tonight,
the fact design,
I'm on my way home,
On the way home,
I lied,
I tried to cry but I'm I'm drowning in the ocean you made,
When salted tears won't dry,
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves,
Under your eyes,
These hearts will be flooded tonight,
I'll wipe my shirtsleeves,
Under your eyes,
Your eyes,
your eyes,
your eyes,
your eyes,

It's late in the evening,
Glass on the side,
I've been sat with you,
For most of the night,
Ignoring everybody here,
We wish they would disappear,
So maybe we could get down now And I don't wanna know,
If you're getting ahead of the programme,
I want you to be mine,
lady,
And to hold your body close,
Take another step into the no-man's land,
For the longest time,
lady I need you,
darling,
Come on,
set the tone,
If you feel you're falling,
Won't you let me know?,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh If you love me,
Come on,

Feel it rushing through you,
From your head to toe,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,

Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Louder!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh,
Sing!,
Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh This love is ablaze,
I saw flames from the side of the stage,
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days,
Until then,
we got nothing to say,
And nothing to know,
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke Let it go until our roads are changed,
Singing ""we found love in a local rave"",
no,
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say,
But I can just figure it out and then hope and pray I told her my name and said ""it's nice to meet ya"",
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila,
I already know she's a keeper,
Just from this one small act of kindness,
I'm in deep if anybody finds out,
I'm meant to drive home but I've drunk all of it now,
Not sobering up we just sit on the couch,
One thing led to another,
Now she's kissing my mouth I need you,
darling,
Come on,
set the tone,
If you feel you're falling,
Won't you let me know?,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,
Oh oh oh-oh oh oh-oh,

Oh oh-oh oh oh oh-oh oh oh Can you feel it?,
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance,
Can you feel it?,
All that I can hear is music from the back,
Can you feel it?,
I found you hiding here so won't you take my hand,
darling?,
Before the beat kicks in again Can you feel it?,
Can you feel it? Sing!,
I need you,
darling,
Come on set the tone,
If you feel you're falling,
Won't you let me know?,

Oh,
woah,
Oh,
woah mmm,
Oh,
woah mmm Come on skinny love just last the year,
Pour a little salt we were never here,
My my my - my my my,
My my,
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer I tell my love to wreck it all,
Cut all of the ropes and let me fall,
My my my - my my my,
My my,
Right in the moment this order's tall And I told you to be patient,
And I told you to be fine,
And I told you to be balanced,
And I told you to be kind And in the morning I'll be with you,
But it will be a different kind,
'Cause I'll be holding all the tickets,
And you'll be owning all the fines Come on skinny love what happened here,
Suckle on the hope in lite brassiere,
My my my - my my my,
My my,
Sullen load is so slow on the spit And I told you to be patient,
And I told you to be fine,
And I told you to be balanced,
And I told you to be kind And now all your love is wasted,
Well then who the hell was I?,
Cause now I'm breaking at the britches,
And at the end of all your lines,
Who will love you? who will fight?,
And who will fall,
far behind?,
Who will love you? who will fight?,
And who will fall,
far behind?"
You're just a small bump unborn,
In four months you're brought to life,
Might be left with my hair,
But you'll have your mother's eyes I'll hold your body in my hands,
Be as gentle as I can,
But for now you're a scan on my unmade plans,
A small bump,
in four months you're brought to life And I'll whisper quietly,
And give you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me,
I'll put my future in you You are my one,
and only,
And you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
You are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
And you'll be alright You're just a small bump,
I know you'll grow into your skin,
With a smile like hers,
And a dimple beneath the chin Fingernails the size of a half grain of rice,
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide,
A small bump,
in four months you'll open your eyes And I'll hold you tightly,
And tell you nothing but truth,
If you're not inside me,
I'll put my future in you You are my one,
and only,
And you can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
Oh you are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
And you'll be alright Then you can lie with me,
with your tiny feet,
When you're half asleep,
I'll leave you be,
Right in front of me for a couple weeks,
So I can keep you safe 'Cause you are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
Oh you are my one,
and only,
You can wrap your fingers around my thumb and hold me tight,
And you'll be alright Cause you were just a small bump unborn,
for four months then torn from life,
Maybe you were needed up there but we're still unaware as why"
Filled up with doubt,
I have to move home,
But I want to stay with you,
For all of the summer,
I have my plan,
That you wont remember,
If you want to see the world,
Then please ask your mother,
I cannot hold your hand,
To watch you go,
I am a liar,
As you might know,
I need you now,
I need your touch,
And your lips,
I need that smile,
And your kiss You're so cool,
You're so beautiful,
You're so,

From my window,
When it is late at night,
It'll show me your shadow I have my plan,
That you wont remember,
If you want to see the world,
Then please ask your mother,
I cannot hold your hand,
To watch you go,
I am a liar,
As you might know,

You look so wonderful in your dress,
I love your hair like that,
The way it falls on the side of your neck,
Down your shoulders and back,
We are surrounded by all of these lies and people that talk too much,
You got the kind of look in your eyes as if no one knows anything but us Should this be the last thing I see,
I want you to know it's enough for me,
'cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need So in love,
So in love,
So in love,
So in love You look so beautiful in this light,
You silhouette over me,
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes is the Tenerife Sea,
And all of the voices surrounding us here they just fade out when you take a breath,
Just say the word and I will disappear into the wilderness,
Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me,
'cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need,
So in love So in love,
So in love,
So in love,
Lumiere,
darling Lumiere over me,
Lumiere,
darling,
Lumiere over me,
Lumiere,
darling,
Lumiere over me,
Should this be the last thing I see I want you to know it's enough for me,
'cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need,
So in love,
So in love,
So in love (love,
love,
love),
So in love,
You looked so wonderful in your dress,
I loved your hair like that,
And in the moment I knew you Beth"
She's reinventing loving me,
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa,
It must have been about 5.01,
Like my blue ripped jeans And my eyes are closed,
And I'm way too tired Hoody still smells of the beach bonfire,
On the sofa,
where we lay,
I wanna stay inside all day And it's cold outside,
again,
And we're both so high We could fly to Berlin,
Tokyo or Jamaica,
We can go where you want,
Say the word and I'll take ya,
But I'd rather stay on the sofa,
On the sofa,
with you When the morning comes,
We're not watching Formula I,
It's not what we breathe for,
So kick off the day with Friends on T4 Two,
boiled and brew,
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you On the sofa,
where we lay,
I wanna stay inside all day And it's cold outside,
again,
And we're still so high,
We could fly to Berlin,
Tokyo or Jamaica,
We can go where you want,
Say the word and I'll take ya But I'd rather stay on the sofa,
On the sofa,
with you And it feels like I'm flying,
And it feels like,
We could go to Berlin,
Tokyo or Jamaica,
Through the streets of New York,
That is where I will take ya,
Paris,
Rome,
to Rio,
Passing through Las Vegas,
We can go where you want,
Say the word,
and I'll take ya,
But I'd rather stay on the sofa,
On the sofa,
On the sofa,
with you"
Take me with you I do declare,
I love you dearly through here and there,
What can I do to make you share?,
What can I do to make you care? The world is harsh,
I'm stuck in the dark,
I'll make my mark,
I've got my spark We'd be together through bad or worse,
Sending letters we shall converse,
We could do better but we must first,
Make amends,
That depends,
Will you be my friend? The world is harsh,
I'm stuck in the dark,
I'll make my mark,
I've got my spark"
You're not her,
Though I try to see you differently,
I towed the line,
you see,
I'm searching for what used to be mine,
oh,
And I saw your eyes,
And I saw Alice staring back at me,
So I will try to find another one Who's suited to me as well as her,
I've moved far away from you,
And I want to see you here beside me,
dear,
But things aren't clear,
When we never even tried,
we never even talked,
We never even thought in the long run,
Whenever it was painful,
whenever I was away,
I'd miss you and I miss you,
She was mine,
I was hers,
And all that's in between When she would cry,
I would shelter her,
And keep her from the darkness that will be,
If I moved far away from you,
And I want to see you here beside me,
dear,
But things aren't clear,
whoa When we never even tried,
we never even talked,
We never even thought in the long run,
Whenever it was painful,
whenever I was away,
I'd miss you and I'd miss you,
Don't drop me in,
it's not my time,
If you cut deep then I might burn at you,
Scar and left me like a sunburn,
Don't drop me in,
it's not my time,
If you cut deep then I might burn at you,
Scar and leave me like a sunburn We never even tried,
we never even talked,
We never even thought in the long run,
Whenever it was painful,
whenever I was away,
I'd miss you and I miss you"
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill,
I threw the day old tea from the cup,
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made,
Memories of a life that's been loved,
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals,
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink,
Dad always told me,
""Don't you cry when you're down"",
But mum,
there's a tear every time that I blink Oh I'm in pieces,
it's tearing me up,
but I know,
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved So I'll sing Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum,
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up,
Spread your wings as you go,
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah,
You're home Fluffed the pillows,
made the beds,
stacked the chairs up,
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case,
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek,
And wiped a tear from the side of my face I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know,
A life with love is a life that's been lived So I'll sing Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum,
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up,
Spread your wings as you go,
And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah,
You're home Hallelujah,
You were an angel in the shape of my mum,
You got to see the person I have become,
Spread your wings and I know,
That when God took you back he said Hallelujah,
You're home"
I woke up early looking out my window,
At the Amsterdam sky,
Oh baby I was high last night,
Cafe clouds and red lights,
When I gotcha in mind,
You slowed down time,
Oh baby I was out of my mind,
Sing a song cover and hold me tight I drill you deep into my chest,
That's where it feels the best,
You can remove all the scars,
Stop them from breaking my heart,
Been on a hurting spree,
That brought out the worst in me,
'cause I don't want to be alone 'cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one,
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue,
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs,
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing another song Cafe clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky,
Oh baby what a beautiful sight,
But we're only satellites,
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights,
Oh baby I am so damn high,
Have you seen my eyes With the beat beat of my heart,
You take me back to the start,
Where everything began,
Holding you inside my hands,
Between my fingers and thumb,
I seal you in with my tongue,,
'Cause I don't want to be alone 'Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one,
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue,
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs,
Sweet Mary Jane won't you me sing another song Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane,
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane,
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane,
Na na na na na Sing another song Mary Jane,,
I've been hoping alone,
Mary Jane,,
Since you came along,
Mary Jane,,
I'm almost home,
Mary Jane,,
Sing another song 'Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one,
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue,
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs,
Sweet Mary Jane won't you me sing another song 'Cause everyday that I'm breathing,
sweet Mary Jane,
I love the sound of your sweet words,
sweet Mary Jane,
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs,
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song"
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow,
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know,
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in,
I never want to get bitten,
Cause plagiarism is hidden,
Watch how I sit on the rhythm,
Prisoner with a vision,
Signed to a label,
But didn't listen to any criticism Thought you knew but you didn't,
So perk your ears up and listen,
Studio is the system,
And you could say that I'm driven,
And now it's onto the next saga,
We drink the best lager,
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather,
I do my own thing now,
And get respect after,
And I'm avoiding the 'caine,
Like it was Get Carter For four years I never had a place to stay,
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded,
Like a paper weight,
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home,
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked,
Went from sleeping at a subway station,
To sleeping with a movie star,
And adding to the population,
Not my imagination,
I don't wanna relax Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back love No I take it back with the rhythm and blues,
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news,
Tryin' act like Jack Black,
When I bring it to school,
I make a beat with my feet,
By just hittin' the loop,
Bringing the lyrics to prove,
That I can fit in these shoes,
I give you the truth through the vocal booth,
And stars burst out on the scene,
Like an opal fruit,
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot,
But then again that's what they're supposed to do,
And I'm supposed to be calm,
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm,
Whispering everything that happens,
Is from now on I'll be ready to start again By the end of the song,
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong,
But then I've never had an enemy,
Except the NME but I'll be selling,
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be,
With only spectacles ahead of me,
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree,
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids,
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic,
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it This song's from the heart cover the planet,
I take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us Don't you fade into the back love,
No,
And take it back now Now I don't ever wanna be perfect,
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless,
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed,
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus,
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton,
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless,
Rhyming over recordings,
avoiding tradition,
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written,
Now absence can make your heart ache,
But drinking absinth can change your mind state,
Vividly need to let my liver be,
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends,
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me,
And I hope to see him blowing up globally,
'Cause that how it's supposed to be,
I'm screaming out vocally,
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams,
But,
but I just write schemes I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans Madison Square Garden is where I might be,
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates having a pint of Mcdaid discussing records we made and every single second knowing that we'll never betray the way we were raised remembering our background sat down,
that's how we plan it out,
It's time to take it back now Mmmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back love,
No Mmm come on and take it back love,
Come on and take it back for us,
Don't you fade into the back love,
No"

You look so wonderful in your dress,
I love your hair like that,
The way it falls on the side of your neck,
Down your shoulders and back,
We are surrounded by all of these lies and people that talk too much,

I want you to know it's enough for me,

This city never sleeps,
I hear the people walk by when it's late,
Sirens bleed through my windowsill,
I can't close my eyes,
Don't control what I'm into This tower is alive,
The lights that blind,
keep me awake,
Hood up and lace untied,
Sleep fills my mind,
Can't control what I'm into London calls me a stranger,
A traveller,
This is now my home,
my home I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here,
sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps then that makes two The pavement is my friend,
It will take me where I need to go,
I find it trips me up,
And puts me down,
This is not what I'm used to And the shop across the road,
Fulfils my needs and gives me company,
When I need it,
Voices speak through my walls,
I don't think I'm gonna make it,
Past tomorrow London calls me a stranger,
A traveller,
This is now my home,
my home I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here,
sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps then that makes two And my lungs hurt and my ears bled,
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head,
Do I need this to keep me alive?,
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along London calls me a stranger,
This is not my home,
home I'm burning on the back street,
Stuck here,
sitting in the backseat,
I'm blazing on the street,
What I do isn't up to you,
If the city never sleeps then that makes two"
Now I don't wanna hate you,
Just wish you'd never gone for the man,
And waited two weeks at least,
Before you let him take you,
I stayed true,
I kind of knew you liked the dude from private school,
He's waiting for the time to move,
I knew he had his eyes on you,
He's not the right guy for you,
Don't hate me cause I write the truth,
No,
I would never lie to you,
But it was never fine to lose you,
And what a way to find out!,
It never came from my mouth,
You never changed your mind,
But you were just afraid to find out,
But fuck it,
I won't be changing the subject,
I love it,
I'll make your little secret public,
it's nothing,
I'm just disgusted with the skeletons you sleep with in your closet,
To get back at me,
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep,
Fact is you're mad at me because I backtrack so casually,
You're practically my family,
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be,
But tragically our love just lost the will to live But would I kill to give it one more shot?,
I think not I don't love you baby I don't need you baby,
I don't want you no,
Anymore I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't wanna love you no,
Anymore Recently I tend to zone out,
Up in my headphones to Holocene,
You promised your body but I'm away so much,
I stay more celibate than in a monastery,
I'm not cut out for life on the road,
Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much,
And at the time we'd just go,
So sue me,
I guess I'm not the man that you need,
Ever since you went to UNI,
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack,
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad,
But when I broke the industry,
That's when I broke your heart,
I was supposed to chart and celebrate,
But good things are over fast,
I know it's hard to deal with and see this,
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features,
Then I turn the music off And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces,
Jesus,
I never really want to believe this,
Got advice from my dad,
And he told me that family is all I'll ever have and need I guess I'm unaware of it,
Success is nothing if you have no one left to share it with I don't love you baby I don't need you baby,
I don't want you no,
Anymore I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't wanna love you no,
Anymore And since you left,
I've given up my days off,
It's what I need to stay strong,
I know you have a day job,
But mine is 24/7,
I fell like writing a book,
I guess I lied in the hook cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could,
The irony is if my career and music didn't exist,
In 6 years yeah,
you'd probably be my wife with a kid,
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink,
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's,
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill,
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27,
I'll die from a thrill,
Go down in history as just a wasted talent,
Can I face the challenge,
Or did I make a mistake erasing? It's only therapy,
My thoughts just get ahead of me,
Eventually I'll be fine,
I know that it was never meant to be,
Either way I guess I'm not prepared But I'll say this,
These things happen for a reason and you can't change shit,
Take my apology,
I'm sorry for the honesty,
But I had to get this off my chest I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't want you no,
Anymore I don't love you baby,
I don't need you baby,
I don't wanna love you no,
Anymore"
Pass me a drink,
You say it's gonna take a while,
Your consciousness sinks,
Tears from a crocodile You're wasting your time,
Giving me the speech,
You try to,
don't reach,
Your smile You're holding your tears,
Your inside is dead,
You're eating your fears,
In a cigarette You've waited too long,
To finally see,
The sunshine in the rain,
Is as deep as the sea I've taken the blow,
It's all down on paper,
Had fun in the snow,
But no 'see you later' You're wasting your time,
Giving me the speech,
You try to,
don't reach,
Your smile You're holding your tears,
Your inside is dead,
You're eating your fears,
In a cigarette You've waited too long,
To finally see,
The sunshine in the rain,
Is as deep as the sea"
When your legs don't work like they used to before,
And I can't sweep you off of your feet,
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?,
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks? And,
darling,
I will be loving you till we're 70,
And,
baby,
my heart could still fall as hard at 23,
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways,
Maybe just the touch of a hand,

And I just wanna tell you I am So,

Take me into your loving arms,

This is the start of something beautiful,
This is the start of something new,
You are the one that will make me lose it all,
You are the start of something new And I'll throw it all away,
And watch you fall into my arms again,
And I'll throw it all away,
And watch you fall,
now You are the earth I will stand upon,
You are the words I will sing And I've thrown it all away,
And watched you fall into his arms again,
And I've thrown it all away,
And watched you fall,
now And take me back,
Take me home,
Watch me fall,
down to earth,
Take me back For this is the start of something beautiful,
You are the start of something new"
Waking up,
Midnight November,
And you're still in my bed,
It's kinda rough,
Cause since I met ya,
There's things we've never said So if I go,
For a little while longer,
When I'm home,
We can talk about the big falls of the road If you say go,
I would stop everything,
oh,
My heart would play the role now,
And act like its never been broke,
Though,
my soul Lately I really need to know,
How long,
how long can we be touch and go,
Oh my soul,
How long,
how long can we be touch and go It's not enough,
To say I want you,
'Cause I'll say anything,
I'm holding out,
To feel without a doubt,
I have just been questioning it But if I go,
For a little while longer,
When I'm home,
We can talk about the big falls of the road And if you say go,
I would stop everything,
oh,
My heart would play the role,
And act like its never been broke,
Though,
my soul Lately I really need to know,
How long,
how long can we be touch and go,
Oh,
my soul,
How long,
how long can we be All of my bones,
they scream ""I'm right"",
If you're taking me home to stay the night,
Darling,
my soul would heal If you say go,
I would stop everything,
oh,
My heart would play the role,
And act like it's never been broke,
Oh,
my soul Lately I really need to know,
How long,
how long can we be touch and go,
Oh,
my soul,
How long,
how long can we be touch and go,
How long,
how long can we be touch and go,
How long,
how long can we be touch and go"
I found your hair band on my bedroom floor,
The only evidence that you've been here before,
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore,
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes Never getting dry,
so I get high,
Smoke away the days,
never sleep with the light on,
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye,
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night,
I don't drink like everybody else,
I do it to forget things about myself,
Stumble and fall with the head spin I got,
My mind's with you but my heart's just not So am I close to you anymore,
if it's over?,
And there's no chance that we'll work it out That's why you and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,
You and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied Everybody said we'd be together forever,
But I know that I never wanna settle down,,
Come around,
break up the love like lego now,
Never wanna turn into another like you,
Sleep with my thoughts,
dance with my views Everything's great,
not everything's sure,
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus,
Now I'm in position to be another stalker,
Like everything I say seems to always sound awkward Like our last kiss,
it was perfect,
But we were nervous,
on the surface,
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it,
Pain is only relevent if it still hurts,
I forget like an elephant,
or we can use a sedative,
And go back to the day we fell in love just on first kiss So am I close to you anymore,
if it's over?,
And there's no chance that we'll work it out Oh you and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied,
You and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one that knows I lied Because,
if I was gonna go somewhere,
I'd be there by now,
And maybe I can let myself down,
And I'm thinking I'm unaware,
I keep my feet on the ground,
And keep looking around,,
To make sure I'm not,
The only one to feel low Because if you want,
I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered,
From all that I've done wrong,
And I know you'll say,
That I'm the only one,
But I know God made another one of me,
To love you better than I ever will 'Cause you and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one who knows that I lied,
You and I ended over U.N.I.,
And I said that's fine,
But you're the only one who knows that I lied"
Made of clay,
Shoot me down,
I'll ricochet to the ground,
Words of paint,
Draw me out,
And fill me in with your mouth,
And hold your tongue,
And I know it's over before it's begun,
I lost my way,
So help me out,
And lend your hand 'til I am found,
My voice is mute,
Not to be heard,
So it's up to you,
For you to bring those words,
I,
And I,
Have come undone,
For the last time,
This grief you give,
It takes it's toll,
It dries my heart and drowns my soul,
I am a tree,
Whose branch you broke,
The brittle wood has turned stones,
oh,
I,
And I,
Have come undone,
For the last time,
For the last time,
For the last time,
I,
And I,
Have come undone,
For the last time,
For the last time,
For the last time"
I should ink my skin,
With your name,
And take my passport out again,
And just replace it See I could do without a tan on my left hand,
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle,
And I should run you a hot bath,
And fill it up with bubbles 'Cause maybe you're loveable,
Maybe you're my snowflake,
And your eyes turn from green to gray,
In the winter I'll hold you in a cold place,
And you should never cut your hair,
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder And you will never know,
Just how beautiful you are to me,
But maybe I'm just in love,
When you wake me up And would you ever feel guilty,
If you did the same to me?,
Could you make me a cup of tea,
To open my eyes in the right way? And I know you love Shrek,
Because we've watched it 12 times,
But maybe you're hoping,
For a fairytale too And if your DVD breaks today,
You should've got a VCR,
Because I've never owned a Blue-Ray,,
True say And now I've always been shit at computer games,
Because your brother always beats me,
And if I lost,
I'd go across,
And chuck all the controllers at the TV And then you'd laugh at me,
And be asking me,
If I'm gonna be home next week,
And then you lie with me,
Till I fall asleep,
And flutter eyelash on my cheek,
Between the sheets And you will never know,
Just how beautiful you are to me,
But maybe I'm just in love,
When you wake me up And I think you hate the smell of smoke,
You always try and get me to stop,
You drink as much as me,
And I get drunk a lot So I take you to the beach,
And walk along the sand,
And I'll make you a heart pendant,
With a pebble held in my hand And I'll carve it like a necklace,
So the heart falls where your chest is,
And now a piece of me is a piece of the beach,
And it falls just where it needs to be,
And rests peacefully,
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now,
Against yours now 'Cause maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up,
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me up"
Well I once heard a story about a run-down home,
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone,
He tried to live,
no effort was shown,
He's slowly finding a way back home He had a family with smiles and frowns,
They never could solve his way to be down,
Cause he's one dog who don't want a bone,
He's slowly finding a way back home He had a nice house with windows and doors,
He said to his wife what's mine is yours,
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown,
He's slowly finding a way back home His children have left but the rooms are still there,
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair,
But far from the nest the babies have flown,
He's slowly finding a way back home His wife was an angel sent from above,
He never returned her kisses or love,
But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown,
This man who's finding a way back home So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June,
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon,
He stares at the floor,
no more to roam,
He's slowly finding a way back home Well I once heard a story about a run-down home,
Where a man with regrets lived all alone,
He tried to live,
no effort was shown,
He'll never find a way back home"
Oooh ooh ooh,
Ooooh oooh oooh ooh Oooh ooh ooh,
Ooooh oooh oooh ooh Oooh ooh ooh,
Ooooh oooh oooh ooh Oooh ooh ooh,
Ooooh oooh oooh ooh I am a poor wayfaring stranger,
Travelling through,
this world alone,
There's no sickness,
toil or danger,
And that bright land to which i go,
And I'm going there to see my mother,
And I'm going there no more to roam,
I'm only going over Jordan,
I'm only going over home now Hey ey ey yeah Hey ey ey yeah Hey ey ey yeah Hey ey ey yeah Hey ey ey yeah Hey ey ey yeah Hey ey ey yeah Hey ey ey yeah Mmmm Ooohhh,
I know dark clouds will gather me,
I know my way's rough and steep,
And the beautiful fields lie just beyond me,
And I know my way's rough and steep,
I'm going there to see my mother,
I'm going there no more to roam,
I'm only going over Jordan I'm only going over home now Cause' I am a poor wayfaring stranger,
Travelling through,
this world alone,
There's no sickness,
toil or danger,
And that bright light to which i go,
I'm going there to see my mother,
I'm going there no more to roam,
I'm only going over Jordan,
I'm only going home now"
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon,
But God gave me a stage,
a guitar and a song,
My daddy told me: ""Son,
don't you get involved in,
Politics,
religions or other people's quarrels"" I'll paint the picture,
let me set the scene,
I know when I have children,
they will know what it means,
And I'll pass on these things my family's given to me,
Just love and understanding,
positivity We could change this whole world with a piano,
Add a bass,
some guitar,
grab a beat and away we go,
I'm just a boy with a one-man show,
No university,
no degree,
but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth,
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios,
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote,
Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"" Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment The revolution's coming,
it's a minute away,
I saw people marching in the streets today,
You know we are made up of love and hate,
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade I'll paint the picture,
let me set the scene,
I know,
I'm all for people following their dreams,
Just remember life is more than fitting in your jeans,
It's love and understanding,
positivity We could change this whole world with a piano,
Add a bass,
some guitar,
grab a beat and away we go,
I'm just a boy with a one-man show,
No university,
no degree,
but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth,
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios,
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote,
Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"" Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment I'll paint the picture,
let me set the scene,
You know the future's in the hands of you and me,
So let's all get together,
we can all be free,
Spread love and understanding,
positivity We could change this whole world with a piano,
Add a bass,
some guitar,
grab a beat and away we go,
I'm just a boy with a one-man show,
No university,
no degree,
but Lord knows Everybody's talking about exponential growth,
And the stock market crashing in their portfolios,
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote,
Saying: ""Love could change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"" Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?,
Love can change the world in a moment,
but what do I know?"
Treat me beneath this clear night sky,
And I will lie with you,
I start to feel those butterflies,
When I'm next to you Tell me your secrets Give me a friend,
Let all the good times flood in,
Do I love you?,
Do I hate you?,
I can't make up my mind,
So let's freefall See where we land,
It's been this way since we were young,
We'll fight and then make up I'll breathe your air into my lungs,
When I feel your touch,
Tell me your secrets,
Give me a friend Let all the good times flood in,
Do I love you?,
Do I hate you?,
I can't make up my mind,
So let's freefall,
And see where we land,
Tell me your secrets,
Give me a friend,
Let all the good times flood in,
Do I love you?,
Do I hate you?,
I can't make up my mind,
So let's freefall,
And see where we land"
So,
so you think you can tell,
Heaven from Hell,
Blue skies from pain.,
Can you tell a greenfield,
From a cold steel rail?,
A smile from a veil?,
Do you think you Can tell? And did they get you to trade Your heroes for ghosts?,
Hot as he's for trees? Hot air fora cool breeze?,
Cold comfort for change?,
And did you exchange,
A walk on part in the war,
For a lead role in a cage? How I wish,
how I wish you were here.,
We're just two lost souls Swimming ina fishbowl,
Year after year,
Running over the same old ground.,
What have we found? The same old fears.,
Wish you were here,
Wish you were here"
Today was gonna be the day,
That they're gonna throw it back to you,
By now you should've somehow,
Realized what you got to do,
I don't believe that anybody,
Feels the way I do about you now,
Mmmm,
Back beat,
the word is on the street,
That the fire in your heart is out,
I'm sure you've heard it all before,
But you never really had a doubt,
I don't believe that anybody Feels the way I do about you now And all the roads we have to walk are winding,
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding,
There are many things that I would like to say to you But I don't know how,
I said maybe,
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
And after all You're my wonderwall Today was gonna be the day,
But they'll never throw it back to you,
By now you should've somehow,
Realized what you've got to do Well I don't believe that anybody,
Feels the way I do about you now,
Mmmm And all the roads we have to walk are winding And all the lights that lead the way are blinding,
There are many things that I would like to say to you,
But I don't know how,
I don't know how I said maybe,
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
And after all,
You're my wonderwall I said maybe,
You're gonna be the one that saves me,
And after all,
You're my wonderwall,
Mmmmmmmmmm,
Mmmmmmmmmm,
Mmmmmmmmmm,
Mmmmmmmmmm"
Well my friend it seems we've come too far to disagree,
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast,
The tide is high but we swam in too deep,
To catch your breath,
you tear me apart piece by piece,
You can take away all this mess And I could never think anything less of you,
'Cos you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me,
This pain has outrun me You are all I have left,
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms,
To spur this on,
we left that room too long,
You open wide and all the lies flow out,
To eat you whole,
But we both know that you're too cold And she said 'I can put away,
all those lies And,
show you there's no surprise in me',
Well still,
you break me,
You numb me You still seem to stun me,
This pain has outrun me,
You are all that I have left,
you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me This pain has outrun me,
You are all that I have left,
Exorcise these demons,
But they keep talking to me,
I am no believer But I believe you will relieve me,
I believe you will relieve me,
And that's what's going on,
'Cos you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me,
This pain has outrun me,
You are all that I have left,
you break me,
You numb me,
You still seem to stun me,
This pain has outrun me,
You are all that I have left,
you break me,
You break me,
You break me,
You break me"
Now I'm in town,
break it down,
thinking of making a new sound,
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd,
That's you now,
ciao,
seems that life is great now,
See me lose focus,
as I sing to you loud And I can't,
no,
I won't hush,
I say the words that make you blush,
I'm gonna sing this now See,
I'm true,
my songs are where my heart is,
I'm like glue,
I stick to other artists,
I'm not you,
now that would be disastrous,
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures See,
I'm real,
I do it all,
it's all me,
I'm not fake,
don't ever call me lazy,
I won't stay put,
give me the chance to be free,
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me 'Cause you need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me,

You need me,

I don't need you at all,
You need me I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse,
Hell,
don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell,
Call yourself a singer-writer,
you're just bluffing,
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing I sing fast,
I know that all my shit's cool,
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School,
I came fast with the way I act,
right,
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe And I won't be a product of my genre,
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are,
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya,
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia And musically I'm demonstrating,
When I perform live,
feels like I am meditating,
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me,
'Young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi' 'Cause you need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,

I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me 'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right,
I won't stop till my name's in lights,
At stadium heights with Damien Rice,
On red carpets,
now I'm on Arabian Nights,
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice Long nighter,
short height and I going hyper,
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter,
yeah,
The game's over but now I'm on a new level,
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal People think that I'm bound to blow up,
I've done around about a thousand shows,
But I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch,
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out From day one,
I've been prepared,
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair,
So now I'm back to the sofa,
giving a dose of what the future holds,
'Cause it's another day Plus I'll keep my last name forever,
keep this genre pretty basic,
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it,
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift,
Into another rapper's shoes using new laces I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers,
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for majors,
Nationwide tour with Just Jack,
still had to get the bus back,
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache I hit back when the pen hurts me,
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee,
I'm still the same as a year ago,
But more people hear me though,
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos I'm always doing shows,
if I'm not,
I'm in the studio,
Truly broke,
never growing up,
call me Rufio,
Melody music maker,
Reading all the papers,
They say I'm up.and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator 'Cause you need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you,
You need me,
man,
I don't need you at all,
You need me,

I don't need you You need me,

And use it not to abuse it,
And get infected then facted with the who's who of music,
Who did it,

who's in it Who's what the hell does it matter chitter chatter don't matter,
With the yidi,
yidi,
yada,
Don't matter to me all I want is a bit of dignity Hear me to battle this industry,
Freely to be me in this CD needy world can you hear me?,
Hey,
So I keep singing that When I first started this rapping shit,
I felt pressure from haters,
Became invaded with sadists,
And just developed a hater radar I'm aimed for the stars,
Kept my grind in the dark,
Then they came with the remedy kicking rhymes with the melody,
Hennessey shots and all these fools on the block,
Who said you've got to be a gangster now to raise the top I'm just a normal casual usual everyday type of guy with my head in the sky,
Ed Sheeran urban angel,
Coming ready to die,
So see the signs,
Stand at the side,
Open your eyes and take a look and realise,
The resurrection's arrived,
And as the mist clears,
I arise from my tomb in the skies All alone Alonestar,
Urban angel rising from the ashes surprising,
No haters,
guiding no moving,
I'm steady you can find me in the club Bottle full of bub,
Mummy,
I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex,
I ain't into making love,
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,
You can find me in the club,
club Bottle full of bubbly mummy,
I've got the X if you're into taking drugs,
Into having sex,

Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough,

Rest them on time Now where I come from burning weed it is a 'abit,
A big fat bag of high grade weed you know I got to have it,
Cause if i dont have it in my pocket im going to panic,
Cause like i said where i come from weed smoking is a habit,
We'll do da bun in da place up in the hood,
One of the tings i have inherited like a ghetto man should,
One of dem tings i smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good,
Burning high grade sensimilla yes it makes me feel...,
But me is a man ah talk bout sensimilla is a drug,
And if I start to smoke it ima-nna turn into a thug.,
Where I come from that they talking could that only get ya mug.,
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above.,
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub.,
Where I come from yes we bun it afta we just-a make a love.,
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine.,
I blaze high grade weed all the time. Now my eyes are red Cos you need me,

Man,
I don't need you"
Well I walked from my house to yours,
In a warm cold April rain,
We barely went outdoors,
And your family took the blame,
Take time to be with you,
She can only glare,
I'm a bad influence,
that'll do,
'Cause I need to cut my hair,
Wash my mouth,
change my clothes,
Just don't talk to those friends of yours,
Tell them not to come here anymore,
Time to go,
don't be slow,
This'll only take a mo',
Take yourself right out of my door It's just that they don't care,
Dad said beware,
watch your back,
Just don't reply to that woman there,
And even if she makes a fuss,
Just ignore that trust,
And don't give in to lust,
And leave that one alone,
The girl's trouble Time spent in burnt-down shed,
Add up near two days,
Fall down and cut my head,
Take time to misbehave,
Spend time and be with you,
She can only glare,
'Cause you're a bad influence,
that'll do,
Boy you need to cut your hair,
Wash your mouth,
change your clothes,
Just don't talk to those friends of yours,
Tell them not to come here anymore,
Time to go,
don't be slow,
This'll only take a mo',
Take yourself right out of my door It's just that they don't care,
Dad said beware,
watch your back,
Just don't reply to that woman there,
And even if she makes a fuss,
Just ignore that trust,
And don't give in to lust,
And leave that one alone This is the dancing song,
Close your eyes,
Hypnotise to the beat,
And the movement of the week,
Do that shuffle of your feet,
And pound out the fever,
either,
Dance as you're a true believer,
Cleaner lives are what you don't see,
Fell the weight,
gravitate,
Feel the pace of me,
This world is 2D,
The only thing that's free in life is love,
And that don't come cheap It's just that they don't care,
Dad said beware,
watch your back,
Just don't reply to that woman there,
And even if she makes a fuss,
Just ignore that trust,
And don't give in to lust,
And leave that one alone,
The girl's trouble"
