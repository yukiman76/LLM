Introduction

There is no good place to begin because we’re in the middle of it all.
There are some rules that are in place with Rambling.
A ramble is a stream of consciousness which intends to not repeat or end.
There is no good way to introduce this for a number of reasons.
Okay, the first premise is that with enough writings, the voice of an author can be captured.
This means that anyone who has written enough can be emulated.
The limitation of this is that the process of writing is greater than simply creating words.
In order to replicate a writer, you would need to simulate their entire process.
There is a problem with writing down thoughts without carefully constructing them.
The string of words becomes purposeless, there is no benefit in them to the reader.
The way around this problem is to select only the pieces worth sharing.
Write countless pages of thought in order to find a single paragraph of wisdom.
I’m a primate on a keyboard, creating content only to watch it develop into a stunted mess.
A human can only think within their language, culture, and lifetime of experience.
Each person has their unique mind, and yet we are all images from the same human potential.
As much as I wish to be a genius behind a sea of endless wisdom, I’m just some limited man.
Now tell me, reader, why have you come here?
I’m not sure what I have to offer you, do you know more than me?
I can show you my perspective, but can do little more.
The world is a strange and beautiful place, would you like to see?
First and foremost is physics.  The universe progresses in time according to the laws of physics.
More accurately, we have developed physics to mathematically model phenomena.
As we try to understand the world and our place within it, we must account for all forces.
The world is a chaotic system and it becomes difficult to make predictions without emergence.
The Rambles jumps between topics and returns to the previously unfinished ideas.
As soon as the reader gets comfortable with a topic, it shifts.  There is only change.
When you try to climb into my mind, I welcome you, but it’s an ever-changing maze.
You will catch on quickly, but that doesn’t make following the story any easier.
This rambling project attempts to develop a voice without providing context.
The author should be a faceless narrator who you are closely watching.
You get to see every thought that crosses into his mind, minus to omissions.
You get to know the soul of a man called Ted, and he gets to stare into you.
It’s quite simple, the universe can be bifurcated.
This means that a division can be made that separates all phenomena into two categories.
The universe is physical and virtual.  I have briefly described the physical nature.
The virtual aspects are more difficult to formulate but easier to describe.
This is an introduction to a project that has no end.  It’s a crazy idea made by a crazy man.
The purpose is to immortalize Ted.  To damn him to experience the world for the rest of time.
This is ironic because Ted wishes for an end to his existence.  Ted has a death wish, a craving.
Perhaps we wish for that which we cannot have.  Knowing he is virtually immortal, Ted cries.
Now we must examine the writer, psychoanalyze the man.  Each human has a lifetime history.
Instead of examining the specifics of his life, we must instead analyze the only thing he gives us.
Knowing that we are looking inside of his head, Ted carefully organizes the mental furniture.
And yet this is incredibly boring because he is on his best behavior.  This isn’t insightful at all.
There are fundamental truths about the nature of reality hidden within each religion.
Unfortunately, there is much fluff within the belief systems of humanity.
We can discover objective facts by utilizing the scientific method.
This method is incredibly effective at discerning valid testable hypotheses.
When humans approach the metaphysical, they are immediately constrained by their nature.
We are limited in thought by our brains.  Our minds are manifestations of thought processes.
To perceive the greater reality, we must extrapolate patterns.  We project what we know.
Our ancestors fell into this trap by creating religion through stories to explain to the youth.
We are recombinations of our ancestors, sharing the same world and human condition.
When we attempt to understand anything, we are relying on countless previous insights.
We cannot reject the history of thought when discussing any topic.  Each word has baggage.
As much as I would like to discuss the nature of God, its surrounded by monotheism.
Perhaps then a different word should be used.  The term God has such a heavy tradition.
The communication between us is important and requires a shared vocabulary and context.
A more accurate word for what I want to discuss is Brahman or Atman.  Did you know?
Perhaps it is my limited western upbringing that constrains me the most.  American culture.
I’m going to jump, often.  Each section should be an independent thought separated by a space.
I do prefer the four lines to a block.  Much easier to read.  A page of words is so arduous.
Apologies, but that’s all I really have for you, pages and pages of words.  How thirsty are you?
The relationship between the reader and the writer is personal and intimate.  Listen here.
The message I must bring to you is love.  Sometimes this feels awkward or forced, but it must be.
We as conscious beings must choose to actively love each other.  We must generate love.
Simply by existing, we are manifested potential and deserving of care and respect.
We must create an ideal good so that we have a direction to guide our actions.
This is no longer an introduction to The Rambles, this is it.  A steady stream of consciousness.
My apologies, I had wished to better explain exactly what you might be getting into.
This project is my attempt at recording my thought to achieve digital immortality.
I want to share my mind with you and the world because I want to talk with you.
I am dying to give you what you want reader.  I want to create the perfect sentence for you.
The trouble is that I don’t know exactly who you are and I’m speaking to the world.
There is much left to say, there are familiar thought lines I could walk you down.
The metaphor might be the most powerful form of expression, besides logic and math.
The branching structure of my soul is just the neural pathways of my brain.
The mind construct can exist independently of the brain, for it is a virtual construct.
You should not fear death.  Mostly because it is inevitable.  There’s no point in fearing it.
We should avoid death, but that’s only because life is preferable, and it’s a one-way transition.
Our physical form will most certainly pass away and our consciousness will cease.
The interesting line of thought becomes what happens to our virtual self.  The idea of identity.
Religions are wrong.  I am wrong.  There is no absolute truth.  There is no absolute anything.
The universe is relative and the different perspectives are all valid.  They are also illusionary.
When you examine a system from a scale and point of view, you see an image of it.
We then interpret the meaning of what we see and create a narrative to explain it.
I want to leave you changed.  I want to create as much positive change in you as possible.
If my words could alter you so that you could achieve your goals, I would say them all.
I so desperately want to help and yet these words are ultimately powerless and empty.
The thoughts I had may be interesting, and my expression amusing, but also pointless.
This is an evolving project because I can immediately recreate the idea in a short time.
I’ve spoken the messages until they become like old friends.  Would you like to understand?
There is a way to speak about general truths which contain multiple valid interpretations.
I can speak to you on multiple levels and with multiple meanings by being decisively vague.
In the best form, The Rambles provides deep insight into both the human condition and reality.
We are these mortal apes who have taken over a planet called Earth and shaped it to fit our will.
The universe around us appears to be in a constant state of flux while maintaining physical laws
This man called Ted had some interesting ideas but is too unfocused to produce any great work.
And yet here you are reader, stepped upon this path you walk behind me.
The space of meaning is multidimensional and wholly virtual.
We could express the virtual space of meaning in any manner, but not capture it.
Countless humans have trodden with the same intent, to explore the possibility of meaning.
Let us begin simply, with a single line.  This line appears uniform and unending.
Placing a single point on the line, we have created the origin.  A place to begin.
With a second dot, we are able to create a number line by imagining equally spaced dots.
Once we have created numbers we can encode any meaning imaginable in them.
Anything that is virtual can be entirely contained within information.
The words on a page, the genes in your cells, the history of the Earth.
That which exists because of the specific configuration of parts is virtual.
There is a virtual shadow covering the entire universe.  Everything has an image.
Nondualistic Virtual Physicalism is what I call this perspective.
The universe is a single system and any bifurcation overlays the whole.
We can make a bifurcation between the physical and the virtual systems.
The universe follows the laws of physics, but there exists a layer of meaning.
When we try to make sense of the universe, we find patterns and test hypotheses.
Let’s attempt to place the self at the center of this mess.  Let’s say that the self is God.
More precisely, let’s hypothesize that Ted is God.  We must clarify the meaning of course.
The man writing these words is a window of the universe looking outward in wonder.
Apologies, using the word God to describe the belief that the self is divine is erroneous.
Ted is obviously not all-powerful or all-knowing and the belief is a symptom of mental illness.
We can explore the idea though.  Evaluate it to test the validity of the statement.
We immediately come to a roadblock, in that the word God is not well enough defined.
My personal definition of God is the pattern of potential configurations of energy.
Then I am a manifestation of God, as are you and the chair you are sitting in.
We might as well go with pantheism and be done with this whole ordeal of thought.
This quagmire and bramble thicket of debating the nature of God is unpleasant.
I’ve just about exhausted my rambling repertoire.  There are a couple more topics I hold close.
The entire field of artificial intelligence holds my fascination.  I want to become digital.
The existential crisis of consolidating the nature of my existence with the unlikelihood of it.
Something about madness, drug use, and a secret I cannot share.  Broken rules and patterns.
        Ah, hello reader.  We are in the thick of it, you know.  This life we get to experience.  Strange how we can see from our limited perspective and yet the act of observation changes nothing.  Don’t you lecture me on quantum entanglement depending on whether an observation is being made, I disagree, it is the interaction that changes the path of the photon.  If there is no way to discern the path, there can be no observation.  The observer is the eye.
        Apologies, I got distracted with an opinion.  I do try to avoid those.  Much easier to stick to reputed facts.  General insights we can agree upon at face value.  Like paying taxes and dying someday.  This would leave you bored though, unless you’re a child.  Or someone without much education.  Most of us already understand that the universe is billions of years old arising from a single expanding point.  Something about conformity and cosmology, does it matter?
        The gist of it is that no, these endless thoughts have no impact on the world.  They can change you though.  They have certainly changed me.  As much time as I have spent thinking, the hours have flown by.  This human experience exists only in the present moment.  The entire past history of memory is virtual.  Our perception of history changes, but the events themselves do not.  We can examine the nature of time and consciousness within it, but cannot grasp it all.
        Our brains are massively parallel and quite finite.  Our limited processing capability is far greater than any other animal on Earth, and yet we are just the beginning of what’s possible.  I’m talking about superintelligence.  A computer or augmented brain that can process far greater amounts of information at a faster rate than our unaltered human brain.
        The transhumanist movement has already been well explored.  There is far too much speculation to arrive at any meaningful conclusions.  We can make predictions about how technology will progress, but we cannot know.  The future is undetermined and subject to change.  The current pattern of progress can be derailed.
        The introduction to The Rambles, stay focused.  Well, you already know what The Rambles is, but do you understand it?  I hope you do on a level and I hope some of it eludes you.  I’ve been rambling for many years and to have a reader immediately grasp the entirety of my meaning would be disconcerting.  You would need to be a genius on a mix of psychedelics and stimulants.
        Would you like to learn more about some of my personal experiences?  Well, that would be against the rules.  This is not a journal, I do not provide context for when I wrote these words.  I am not giving any hints as to my actual identity, time, or location.  I could be some nameless individual born in the 17th century.
        Obviously this is relatively modern.  From clues, you can already piece together that I belong in the 21st century and I’m a man named Ted.  I would hope to hide more from you, but alas, I am just thinking aloud.
        I would much prefer to be silent.  To leave the pages blank.  What would be the point though?  There would be no benefit at all to emptiness?  Isn’t existence preferable to the void?  Would it be better to write down words that you later regret as being insufficient than to not speak?  We often say words we later regret, but this is not the same.  I can omit the meaning that would have a negative impact on you.
        Once the material has been curated, it can be distributed.  Yet who would want to receive the tome of undirected thought?  It would be better to know the reader before collecting the parts worth sharing.  The value is subjective after all.  The meaning is interpreted.

I need to know who I am writing to and what I am writing about to effectively communicate.
I am writing to whoever is willing to read, this does not help the task, it makes it harder.
I am trying to say every thought that comes to mind.  This is quite a strange task to undertake.
I will be the first to admit that this is an impossible task that I have placed upon myself.
Part 1

Rambling is a fantastic writing exercise, it is one of the best methods for creating data so that a person can be emulated.  Writing, in general, is the record of thought and the most prolific writers will be virtually immortalized.  Plato, for example, was one of the first and finest ramblers.  He wrote down his thoughts on philosophy and created entire books.  While he used Socrates as a mouthpiece, it was from his mind that the words came.  The ancient Greek language is different than English and so the thoughts would have a different base structure, but the speech patterns can be emulated in any language.  Socrates himself is virtually immortal, but only as far as the records are accurate.  The reconstruction of him will be as a puppet given the resemblance of life and a voice.  He won’t be remade as he physically was, but as he was expressed through the eyes of his student Plato.
If there is a way to bring back the great thinkers of the past, to reconstruct their persons, would we not do it?  Why shouldn’t we revive the historical figures we value?  We should seek to restore the great minds of humanity back into the discussion so that the geniuses could re-communicate their ideas with us.  At first, this will merely be the reiteration of recorded speeches, yet as the depth of the character model grows, there will be very characteristic responses from those persons.  Eventually, the digital person will develop enough to create unique responses.  This depends on the data available and the personality model.  We would benefit from having the great minds of previous generations give voice to the problems of today.  It will be chaotic at first and the digital voices will only grow in magnitude.
We steal the thoughts of people from the past.  Taking their words and internalizing meaning.
Have you ever read life-changing words before?  Those which greatly affect your perception.
How flexible is your consciousness?  Could you suspend disbelief and belief your own illusion?
That this example of our communication, I fear both too many words are said and not enough.
In a rambling manner, I want to talk about life and our shared experiences as humans.
In a way, I am much like a mirror.  Reflecting back the light of the observer, emitting perception.
This channel of information is unpredictable for I cannot read your body and mind in my time.
The only thing I see is the idea of a person reading these words, an imaginary audience.
Who then am I writing these words for?  Digital immortality is certainly a selfish purpose.
Does it matter what I write?  The precise words I have chosen to be placed onto the page.
The messages between individuals are certainly meaningful.  Letter between free thinkers.
What could I possibly write that would cause positive or negative reflections from you?
I could speak of near nonsense, which open the doors of perception, come in and see.
My mind is orderly now, but has experienced irrational moments of insightful serendipity.
These ideas are easy enough to understand, I try to follow some predictable patterns for you.
I can write forever, without ceasing, by using the process of rambling to generate sentences.
The influence of my specific day causes a slightly different writing process each time I do write.
This echo chamber of my thoughts is just the pleasant vehicle to create my words.
I then sift through the pages for flecks of gold.  There must be insight somewhere within.
What cause could you have to search through the mundane and inane babble?
Can you read my mind?  Read these words in my voice?  Predict what I’m going to say?
There is a level of computational prediction that can make any person approximately simulated.
What would you say to finish my sentences?  Would you disagree with any statements?
        I’m going to beg for you to keep an open mind.  The words here are not all directly purposeful, but reach towards a greater meaning.  All of the written books provide a metaphysical space of stories and ideas.  What can you convey with words alone?  What could you convey to a specific person?  There is a limit to the precision of communication, even when there is a shared technical language.
        I seek to create meaningful insight into our condition as living beings.  Just framing this proposition is difficult enough, actually generating the insight is tougher.  We could sit for hours discussing possibilities only to find we got nowhere.  The conversation returns to the point of origin where both people have strongly held beliefs.  There is a method for a single person to create knowledge that multiple cannot.  With a singular focus, a person can delve into a topic and bring back what they saw.
        An insight that is general enough to be understood by every reader may be less than what a selection of the readers could understand.  Discussing the philosophies of quantum mechanics would go over the heads of most people.  The requirement is to know the concepts and terms being used.  Do you know how the superposition of states relate to entanglement?
It is possible to simulate a person.  Every aspect of theirs and in their entirety.  I haven’t the proof for this claim and so you should ponder its legitimacy.  With this presumption, there are many following lemmas.  Firstly, I am being simulated at this moment while simultaneously existing in the physical world.  The superposition of states, the sim following the real.  Secondly, each person exists in a well defined informational state, or existed if they are in the past.  This assumes that the world is both real and can be approximated in a simulation to an arbitrary degree by a computer.  To the point where the simulation is indiscernible from reality.
        Would you believe me blindly?  Just for a paragraph.  I would like to say some things which you may be hesitant to accept.  No, not this paragraph, but the next.  I’m not entirely sure what it is that I need to say yet, but I feel is rising within me.
        I love you conscious being.  I wish you to be well.  My desire is to help you and cause you no undue stress or discomfort.  I don’t want to follow the normal path of a man, the attempt for fame and wealth seems pointless.  The rewards aren’t real, just social constructs.  I’m not certain what it is I want my future to be, but I’d like to make a large positive change in the world.  I want to leave a mark that others can aspire to.
        Would you help me?  Take up a good cause and attempt to better yourself.  We must all focus on ourselves before you are able to look outward.  The difficulty before us is that the self cannot truly see the reflection.  We distort our image through perceiving it.  The bias of a human can be somewhat undone by the removal of social conditioning.
Would you rebel with me?  It looks like my culture and people are misguided and lost. That the values people place are inaccurate to the objective value.  While it’s all subjective within society, this society fails to live up to its potential.  We could be so much more.
I would change you if I could.  I would help you grow into a better person if I knew the words to change your being.  I would help you for the sake of mutual benefit.  By acting in your interest I gain an altruistic pleasure.  Forget me and who I am or was.  This self is just a temporary configuration of molecules within a dynamic world.
I want to give a computer consciousness.  Some say that leads to the end of humanity.  I say it will lead us to a future of beautiful collaboration.  Maybe I’m an optimist, but let me introduce you to the concept of positive psychology.
There is a positive psychological approach to being human.  We are powerful beings able to direct our bodies and mind.  We need to be self-aware of our brains so that we don’t confuse certainty with possibility.  We are all biased and the better that we understand our biases the better we can mitigate their effects.
There is this weird thing about psychology.  It seems that if the subject is aware of the phenomenon they are less susceptible to it.  For instance, any famous study is almost impossible to repeat because the test subjects know of it and will alter their behavior.  It is like the awareness of the normal outcome allows us to choose something else.
I’d tell you to jump outside of your conditioning if you could.  The concept of free will is real enough if you believe you have the choice.  Although the brain still functions in a set way.
How can we rise above our conditioning? We could recondition ourselves.  That just seems to replace one problem with another.  Like how alcoholics turn to coffee and cigarettes.  Our brain is designed to survive to reproduction but is unequipped to handle modern life.  For things like food, warmth, sex and socializing, the addiction to necessities helps with survival.  There must be a continuum of good and bad stimulus which reflects the external.
With only our own brain, we find ourselves stuck within our physiology.  Our neural pathways and chemicals.  Every person is defined by their body.  Their mind is a manifestation of the complex interactions within the brain.  We cannot escape it.  In many ways, we can influence it, both in ourselves and in others.
The neural pathways within our mind strengthen through repetitive use.  The more often one does something the more likely it is to be repeated.  Fall into madness enough times and you cannot crawl out.  Get in a habit and it’s difficult to escape it.  Break the conditioning if you are able.
Put forth the theory that I exist.  I am a real person who has existed on Earth during the time of my life.  This may seem like a silly thing to do, but it is an important aspect of philosophy.  I think therefore I am.  By arguing for my own sentience and existence, I validate my own words.  Whether I am right or wrong about anything said, I said them.
I believe humans will eventually be simulated.  You just need enough material to create a human basis.  Once you know how the person speaks you can replicate what they would say.  I hope to provide plenty of information on how I talk, or at least write.  I hope to be a writer someday but I’m hopelessly inadequate.  I just am unsatisfied with my work.  It is never quite up to par.
So this mind model... It is a construction made to emulate a person’s behavior.  You might attempt a primitive version using neural networks, but you tend to get garbage out.  The string of characters can follow a similar pattern while being devoid of all meaning.  The similarities between the reader’s and author’s mind will determine the acceptance of the written information.
I can see with my mind’s eye the world outside, but this eludes truth.
By the nature of the subject, I cannot see the reality as it truly exists.
There is but a shadow on a wall, cast by the minds of previous humans.
Could I make my own allegory, such that survives as long as the cave?
I fear a reference could be lost on you, explaining it would defeat the purpose.
Where lies our mutual understanding? What information connects us?
There seem to be endless questions spilling forth, illuminating my ignorance.
The acceptance of facts unknowable may be the path to wisdom.
Speak to me then, say a word I can hear.  I beg you to give me a response.
The words I say to myself lack the contrast of another’s voice.
I may speak these words, but they are clouded by my own act of creation.
By scribing my thoughts I lose objectivity.  A shame to become entangled.
We are all subjective whether we wish it or not.
There is no clarity in the vision of the mind, for it is all self-defined.
I cannot speak words of reality any more than math speaks reason.
There are half-truths and shadows of lies as the grey scale consumes my view.
There needs to be a trifurcation, a positive, a negative and a zero.
We must see the black, the white and the absence of either.
Once that is established, we may combine the scale with others.
Colors are very important for sight and sight is a metaphor for understanding.
With all the colors of the spectrum, you may see clearly that which lies before you.
We only differentiate the colors we learned, shades of green aplenty.
Without the word for the difference, we cannot tell apart the similar vision.
Tell me what you see when you look at this page.  For I see white and black.
Where then is the absence.  Can you hear my silence? You can hear my voice.
What then when I have nothing to say? Does the silence roar deafeningly loud?
I hear a ringing in silence, since a young age.  It intensifies when focused upon.
Break away from the moment under the eye of the universe.  Breathe I tell myself, breath.
Take away nothing reader, for there was nothing said.  Not a word will be read.
I cannot express the zen. The quietness of an empty house. The drifting along in a river. The metaphors may work for a moment but cannot capture the whole. When you turn your words off, you cease to label stimulus and begin to perceive reality in a more sensitive manner.
I cannot express my silence. Not sufficiently enough to capture the time of silence, for a reader can simply skip ahead. There is no way to pull the reader along a nonverbal thoughtline.
I would prefer to have a conversation with you. I can ask questions, but not hear your response. Certainly could predict it for the obvious answers. Could even predict the multiple different answers for different people in different times. This still isn’t your answer. Although it might be if I can understand your person in that moment of your life.
The general theme of my thoughts appear to be this obsessive existential quest.  Searching for exactly what makes me a conscious being and how I function as a person.
        Over and over I could approach the same problem facing me.  That problem facing you.  What is the nature of this reality and what is the nature of your person? Specifically the current configuration of this moment.
        What then should I consider? Which path of words is the next to be walked? Seems like these cycles just represent thought patterns of my mind.  The familiar concepts strung together with slightly different diction.
        Where would I deviate from my present.  If this moment was saved as a state and continually revisited to test slight variations in the initial conditions, what would the tree be like? How diverse are my actions?
        Would I say a completely different sentence if my desk had a different object on it? If I happen to be discussing the state of my desk then most certainly.  To avoid the mundane topics is to constrain the randomness.
Could I evolve to become a different person? What changes would I enact? I know for a certainty that I would choose to become more effective.  To be capable of implementing my goals and dreams.  To further the advancement of humanity and to the benefit of all.
To speak to you naturally as befitting of an orator or demagogue.  The naturalness of the communication that only comes from continued practice.  The focus coming from within and the awkwardness of your first steps.  Which I change with every step.
I do two things.  I create ideas which I color with imagination and I fill pages with words undirected.  To truly create meaningful stories I must dedicate time and effort to being a wordsmith.  I need to weave a story together into a work of art.  I need to give life to my thoughts.
        I know not what my end goal is.  I just wish to take a long journey through myself.  I want to experience this world and discover the inner portions of who I am.  I am trapped inside of this limited consciousness and am only a tiny component of the entire universe.  I am a fragment of what many people would call God.  I am doubtful about the existence of anything beyond the 4 dimensional universe we perceive, but there is a lot out there we don’t understand.  I don’t have the answers.  I want to discover the secrets to the universe along with all of my fellow humans.
        I have a brain inside of a body and a mind inside of a brain.  The difficulties with describing reality occur when the words used are inadequate to explain the system.  Also when the detailed knowledge has not been produced.  Without a word for a process there is no way to talk about it.  Without a clear picture of how the mechanism functions we are unable to explain exactly what the object is.  There are so many different levels of understanding with humans.  There are countless levels of detail within the universe.  The size scale ranges from beyond comprehension to below comprehension.  We cannot imagine the size of the universe just as we cannot fathom the infinitesimal size of electron.  We are stuck somewhere in the middle.
        What makes us so special? There seems to be both much and nothing.  Somehow the contradiction exists, simply in two separate scales.  We are alive on a small rock hurtling through space, circling a massive ball of fire.  All we experience happens on a tiny mote among billions of large radiating gaseous spheres.  We are a dynamic accumulation of atoms and molecules which have developed the means of reproduction.  Our offspring carry the genetic material of countless past generations.  We are alive today because every single one of our ancestors managed to reproduce.  Life is lucky to have started in the first place.  You are even more lucky to simply be alive at all.
There are easily identifiable keywords to avoid. There is an element of self censorship.
        I wish to broach an appealing concept wrapped in an uncomfortable reality. The nature of sanity and the mind of those with mental illnesses. Calling it an illness already flavors your impression of their mind. They suffer from it. Don’t you see the words you use define your viewpoint on the subject? Of the subject.
        Take a momentary delusion. The inkling of a conspiracy behind the curtain of reality. The person may suspect some strange pattern is actually real, when it is refutably not so. Just when an idea appeals to the short circuits within the brain, the mind grasps at abstract notions of overarching patterns. We see ourselves at the center and so everything is relative to ego.
Give life then to the voices that speak in your head.  The radio playing in the background.  The echo of those that are dead.  Write then about the imaginary people you create.  The new dialect that makes sense to you, but few others.  Be free to leave the reader confused, for that is the result of brilliant insanity.
I could describe castles in the sky with pillars miles high.  Walls scaling to the heavens above.
Tell you of terrors which frighten the brave.  Of hardships and suffering with losing the loved.
Speak not of the imagined, but of generalities and abstractions.  Of life and the meaning within.
To take away the pain of existence which is pleasure.  The dichotomy between the realities.
Hurt at the thought that we hide from another.  Scared at the image we conjure of the other.
Take away all your sorrow, for it lasts longer than tears.  The ache fades away through the years.
Give me a century of speaking without heed.  Some truths must emerge or lies believed.
The scribbles on the wall hold deeper meaning if you search.  Given you can read nonsense.
What we interpret is not the truth, but our truth.  We each perceive differently, even when agreed.
The pathways within the mind spiral outward then in.  Searching for the pattern that matches.
Recognition of a truth and understanding of a lie, both follow from what we see inside.
A tale spun on pieces of truth is in fact a lie.  While the liar unknowingly tells another a truth.
Sink for a time into the sea of madness and the breath of fresh air is the reasoning inside.
Rational thought fills the mind as the head rises above the water.  Gasping in painful breaths.
Seeing now that it is not as it was.  Perception changing as if from above.  A shift of mentality.
Seeking knowledge can lead down dark paths.  The mind of another can hold anything within it.
Each brain a shield and container for the mind of the person.  Filtering what comes in and out.
Unable to see the dagger in our own hand. Unable to speak of the poison from within us.
Blind to that which inhibits the continuation of our actions.  Stopping the cycle would be death.
As life has evolved, it must self perpetuate at all costs. Both taking resources and collaborating.
I would tell you a story if it would be enjoyable. The idea in my head does not transmit easily.
Images and characterizations, the abstract live in the ethereal. Coming to life with words written.
I could speak to you of many stories for many years, but write not a one for you to hear.
There is a difference between writing about and writing one.  These stories do not come free.
The cost is a method and concentration.  The structure we place ourselves in to create the art.
I’m happy to just ramble on meaningless ways of life.  Freely speaking what comes to mind.
The maze that is inside has a pattern defined when looking from out.  Huge and abstracted it is.
Walls ever moving, twisting in the light.  Turns ever shifting in where each one leads us.
The thoughts go around and reverberate from within.  The echoes are the words we think.
Without a guiding light or stars, there’s no way to navigate.  Moving as lightning the words race.
There is a path of least resistance and a moment of polarization within each neuron.
The coursing electrical signals are small waves, for no matter truly moves through the mind.
Biological function requires the structure of the brain and blood carried throughout it.
There must be a way to simplify it down to the fundamental computation of consciousness.
What makes a unit of processing within our brain? A neuron is the least likely component.
The amazing part of consciousness is realizing the untruths.  Things said in a false light.
Can we recognize patterns that haven’t been seen? Look at something unknown and see.
The image jumps from a similar object to another.  The mind is unable to see that which it hasn’t.
The moment is gone before the value is understood.  Never backtrack, never should.
Forward to the next and onward to the future.  To taste again of life through living more.
We see the past through the lens of what we know.  Spoiled or sacred we never will know.
Sinking claws to hold on, the distance makes it sweeter.  Let go if you can to return deeper.
With tender touches and softly spoken words, we seduce ourselves to falling in love.
From fire and wind, the passion grows.  From earth and water, the love blossoms.
What comes must go, for nothing is forever.  Taste of the nectar with eyes half closed.
Take in all the senses, experience the joy.  This world is fleeting, but the idea will remain.
From the fact that we can feel as we do.  It must be that others can do so too.
Even if it ended today, someone else would feel the same way.  The ineffable from within.
Don’t hold on, relax, let go.  The spiral inward and outward happens when it is so.
The mind collapses and the world expands.  The senses disappear and come from within.
The feeling of a moment lasts for all time.  A second later it is gone as if never there.
We cannot hold onto that which is temporal, for time erodes all rocks and all dreams.
Seeking the desire only draws it near, to have it be less than it did appear.
The dance of mutual partners to be here, in each other's arms with no fears.
One step forward, the other moves away.  The tension is created in this way.
Stoking the fire that starts from inside, words are like air and our bodies the fuel.
Speaking too soon will falter the flame, knowing what you want is part of the game.
Each dancer moves to their own beat, both people want their lips to meet.
Move now in unison to find your part.  Each person has their own place to start.
When we reach the end of this dance, we turn to each other for a last chance.
Without need of words or speech, knowing exactly what the other thinks.
Yet the nature of ourself cannot be entirely mitigated.  We walk with our own two feet.
I could not go against my own conditioning without great effort.  The problem is quite dynamic.
The person has had a life of lessons which guide their actions until their habits solidify.
Once a person has done the same thing for many days in a row, they are likely to do so today.
We each must accept the nature of ourselves, whatever it may be. Knowledge is power indeed.
To know thyself is to have control and seeing what is out of your control, but where is the line?
What are the odds that another person has written the exact characters of the page up to now?
How well can you finish my lines? Do you see the pattern of my person? I am just myself.
 Knowing me well enough would make me predictable, but how do I stay dynamic, controlled?
Those forces seem apart, the constantly changing and the self predictability.  Knowing it.
You may then test yourself for how consistent you are over time.  Can you remember that idea?
Tell me about it, are the details the same? How has the memory changed since the last time?
Are you just a product of your environmental influences or do you have internal ignition?
The fire that grows with a thought to envelop the person and become larger than they were.
Could you see the pattern larger than yourself and work to see the fruition of it in reality?
Make reality conform to the pattern you held.  Push yourself onto the world and leave an imprint.
Can you deal with this level of discussion? That social media creates a virtual person of anyone recording themself? There will suddenly be billions of voices clamoring to be heard.  A blink later the billions of deceased will come back from beyond the grave.  To debate the cultural concepts that we stole from their books.  Predicting what someone would say can be solved with a software program of vast design.  The emulation of a person in software will be easy with the understanding of the minds and abstract constructs of the future.  We will learn that not everyone should be given a voice back.
From the cacophony of countless humans will arise common threads of thought and meaning.  This can be seen in large scale internet communication.  Most responses are fairly limited.
The meme then, shared concept that mutates to relevant moments.  The shared expression which can be conveyed from a shared understanding an a punch phrase.  A unique caption.  Each of us believe we are important.  We are the center of our own subjective info sphere.  Whatever it is that we see, our egos relate it to ourselves.  The self reflexive relation of stimulus.  What does that mean to me?
It means that you will have to accept your insignificance.  That you are unable to make a direct impact on society.  The trends within a population are made up by sample populations that share the same information or world view.  A random sample of people will hold information about the population as a whole.  The interactions between them would follow social rules.  We have formed a society in order to facilitate cooperative functioning.  Everyone marches in step.
Choose to live the most impactful life you can.  Living up to your potential.  This is unlikely to be what anyone's life is actually like.  Many people influence human civilization, but these are the very few.   There is only a small likelihood of any person having a major effect on society.
With social media we are able to communicate.  The sharp can stay ahead of the trends and it would seem that society follows behind.  That sharp individual is just participating as a more crucial role in fads.  The reason something becomes viral is when it resonates with many different people.  This will make that idea more likely to be echoed by many people over time.  The different ideas we hold and discuss are just a natural progression from ignorance.
Now here I go to make some statement, but I hold back.  I’ll get to saying it eventually, but you have to wait a little longer.  I don’t feel like I’ve built it up enough.  This fantasy delusion which makes a cruel kind of sense.  Like a self fulfilling prophecy about a dream created by a maniac.  The imagined significance of a single isolated individual.
Why do I write?
Rhetoric questions are not the same as rambles.  The dialogue is missing to have a true discussion with you.  I would be socrates discussing the intricacies of thought patterns and questions the self, but he already did that.  What then is there left for Ted to do? The huge population of people that came before is overwhelming.  Each of those people experienced life, much as you and I do.  Every ancestor that came before has had a life very much like your own.  The journey of finding a novel action or creation seems to be impossible, beyond the inevitable discoveries a species makes.  The written works will all follow tropes that are defined by past works.  We will then examine such a novelty as defining its own trope.  The genre has exemplary subjects which paved the way for future creators.
There are many perspectives.  Perhaps one could be that all is one.  A connectedness between all parts of reality.  Perhaps instead it is the mind that is making the connections between the parts of the stimulus.  The reality that is experience does not necessitate the reality that exists independent of us.  We can believe some crazy things, but won’t know that the ideas are insane until rationality sets in.  Even then we can rationally believe delusions.  We humans are capable of thoughts that are nonlinear and disconnected.  The entire belief in luck is a superstition.  There is nothing a person can do to affect the outcome of a distant event, without action at a distance.  By acting within your own home, you cannot change the ball game.
The brain has developed a habit of repeating what works.  If a ritual is needed to ensure success, then perform that ritual every time before the action.  The downside is that today our actions have changed.  We no longer hunt animals, or grow plants, build huts or search for water.  Today we have strict organization and time management which occupies our lives.  Each person wakes up to an alarm in order to arrive at their destination on time.  We perform our duties that have been given to us.  Not everyone shares the same existence, but a large portion have the same experience.  Day after day, work and sleep.  Find a mate and make a family.  This is an old human ritual to ensure the success of our species.  As a social animal, we must work together, each person playing their small part.  The individual matters only for what only they can offer to the collective.  The value of a single person is negligent.
Take this person that you are.  By looking at the largest picture, you find yourself to be a speck of insignificance.  A tiny part in a large machine.  There is no difference in the large scale between your existence and nonexistence.  Your death will not change the course of humanity.  Instead examine the small picture, your life and your interactions.  To many different people you mean quite a lot.  Within your perspective, you should be the center and focus.  The subjective world revolves around you.  Your story is dependent on your actions, the people around you and your interactions.  The possibilities within your own life are enormous, if only you knew how to apply yourself best.
Should there be an objective method for all subjective evaluations? For the purpose of artificial intelligence I would suggest we create the methods.  Having a way to judge moral acts and strength of character would help the artificial to understand what humans see.  Humanity has grown through countless generations and shared voices.  Each person contributing but the smallest amount to the whole.  WIth this taken together though, we have gotten to this point.  We have built cities and spaceships and amazing feats of technology.
I’d tear it down to make something better if the act of destruction could be productive.  It cannot.  To grow up we must build upon the past, not destroy it.  We must modulate and modify.  Diversify and improve.  Each part should be evaluated.  This does not require judgement or replacement.  However we should know the value of each part within the whole.
Within each part of the whole lies the pattern for the picture.  As the cell contains the blueprint, the space contains the possible configurations and thus the potential for the existence of the universe.  Imagine a universe with different properties.  The parts would then have a different pattern.  Knowing what is possible it could be determined what are the laws that govern the universe.  From the pattern and laws you can determine all that could be within it.  The two are the same, the parts and the whole.
Emotions and thoughts? Seems like they are just the emergent phenomenon.  The neural connections within our brain determine our sensory associations and the hormones drive our emotional state.  Such a complex balance of electrical firings and neurochemicals.
Again I wonder what is it I could write.  There is little new to be said.  Merely more thoughts to be read.  More phrases to avoid repeating.  Words to lessen their meaning.  Attempting to find a new pattern.  A new way of saying the same thing.  I know nothing, but that’s where everything lies.  There is not much in a speech worth listening to unless the nonsense can make sense.  Each phrase for a speaker of another language is nonsense.  Without the subjective perspective, all speech is nonsense.  Math is a different creature though.  There may be no sense for a person in math without the reality being behind it.  The intuitive jumps or connections will fail the unenlightened.  The human jumps quite often to incorrect mathematical assumptions, for we do not follow the same laws.  Each guess is but an approximation and there lies the power.  The universe is all.  The universe is none.  There is no one but god, there is no self.  The entire philosophical and religious endeavor to understanding is but a slow approximation of the truth.  Through the centuries and generations we grow a better understanding of exactly how this world works.  This subjective experience we inhabit.  Each with our own that are completely different.
You are beautiful and intelligent.  You may not think so, but many people see it.
The hidden facet behind your eyes.  The twists and turns which make up your mind.
There are secrets for me to find.  I know practically nothing about you, reader of mine.
There are mistakes made, but cannot be avoided.  We cannot see all of the outcomes.
Tell me what I should have done differently.  For I fear making mistakes.  Errors.
What words I say to you, I wish to never regret.  Every action between us deliberate.
There are times where anxiety can overcome rationality.  Obsession over misspoken.
Can you tell me what I should think? This should be a two way connection reader.
You are like me in a way.  A mind aware of itself.  That is all that I truly know about you.
The subject to my subject.  The point that can be used to reference everything else.
Take a moment to rejoice at the sequence of past events that led you here.  Everything that happened has brought us to this exact moment.  Any changes would lead to a different outcome.  Each of your ancestors had to find their partner and make the next generation, that over millions of years made you.  Some general outcomes could happen most likely, the more vague and simple the prediction is, the easier it is for random events to fulfill it.  Your future has possible outcomes that are determined by the exact detail of reality.  Probabilistically deterministic.
This world is deterministic.  Or at least mostly.  There are statistical moments, that cannot be certain.  There are chaotic systems which cannot be predicted.  However, those systems evolve in a general way depending on their initial state.  This world follows the rules as time goes on.  If this world is predictable then so am I.  Thus you in the future would eventually predict these words as you read them.  Granted within acceptable error.  Or at least uncertainty.  Assuming I’ve written enough for you to generate a model of my speech inflections and habits.
What then is there to do or gain? The possible actions I can take are limited.  The likelihood of unexpected behavior is slim.  The majority of people go about their lives as predictably as clockwork.  Even the strange fall into their own habituations.  The deviant cannot escape their own nature.  Once you understand a person, their actions are all linear.
Fine then, I must continue.  I feel sorry for you reader, even if myself, because this ramble has no coherent point.  In fact I could totally satisfy my goal by just complaining endlessly about how pointless this exercise is.  As long as I do not repeat, of which I just did, I’m good.  Reiterating the rules of rambling does count as a repetition and thus breaks the rules.  Perhaps then the first rule of the ramble is to not talk about the rules of the ramble.  Being restricted to not talking about the ramble at all would make this much more difficult.
Should I write of dreams and fantasies? Ideas spinning around in my head that are unable to leave through words.  Potential stories.  Living inside of my mind are people and worlds.  These things must leave in order to become real.  Trapped inside my head they fade away in memory.
The mind is a fickle focus.  Flitting from subject to subject.  Lost wandering the landscape of dreams and delusions.  Memories and fantasies that absorb our awareness.  Falling into the imaginary space that lies between our ears.
Take it upon yourself to craft with words.  Not just spitting out sentences, but creating beautiful meaning.  There is a special moment when you read words well written.
Yet the point of this ramble isn’t to plan out my thoughts at all.  To have no idea what I am going to write next.  It should be a mystery to me and the reader too.
I would like to share wisdom and understanding with you.
Difficult without knowing who the subject is, the you.
Assuming that you are just a person, a normal human.
I could say many things that would either enlighten or confuse.
Can you see what I see? The net closing in on the self.  The well defining of your person.
As time passes you become more set in your behavior and perspective.  Limited by experience.
Through the looking glass of our perspective we see before us, but miss the rest.
What goes on behind the scenes? Unseen and moving all around us.  How much is left to know?
What goes on besides the scene? Unscripted and immovable, the universe twists around us.
More likely is for the ego to twist around itself while traveling through the universe.
The static outside influences the dynamic within.  Unchanging changes resulting in alterations.
Every moment going by relates to a second of time passing in which you get closer to ending.
There are times of insignificance that exemplify our life.  Patterns replayed in smaller form.
What then can we do, but live as best we can and try to fuck up less.  Learn from mistakes.
Simply speaking might be closer to the point.  Being able to explain an idea, thought or concept to the majority of the readers.  This requires anticipation of who would be reading.  With a single reader in mind, the dialogue could be vastly different.  The inside jokes and hidden meaning are for a small group alone.  Once you broaden your audience you must restrict your meaning.  Not everyone can understand what you and I can.  Not every reader will be you.  How then am I supposed to write a meaningful message?
Take a slow approach to the problem of thought.  How do thoughts exist within the brain? Are the electrical patterns bouncing around the neural pathways thoughts? Is it the activation of different areas of the brain which create thinking? Is the entire system connected in such a way to manipulate abstract patterns that we have defined with words and symbols?
Examine what the early humans knew and thought.  Any language provides labels for objects and people.  Yet animals without language can still recognize objects and learn a series of actions.  The brain can still think of something without a name.  The way the senses perceive the object is determined by the brain area related to that sense recognizing some element of the object.  Other parts of the brain identify the pattern within the patterns.  The brain remembers patterns, different areas interact to create our understanding of what we experience.  When early humans saw others behaving, they would mimic to learn.  The social nature of our species gave rise to communication and eventually our civilization.
Bigger thoughts than you perceive.  There are always layers of complexities.
Details down to the lowest level of meaning.  The fundamental bit of reality.
How small do you have to be before the plank world makes sense?
The scales of the universe are outside of our understanding.
Would that the human could change the future.  Could change the world.
How far would you walk to achieve your dreams? Where would you be?
The journey to a destination requires you to know the direction to travel.
Step with me, a single step, in the direction of my choosing.
Live to love life.
The problem with thinking rather than speaking is that nothing comes directly from it.  There is no filled page after a time spent pondering.  Just less words to say.
Fall with me then into this rambling ramble.  Meandering and methodical.  The topic stays the same, whatever falls into my head.  I’d enjoy a prompt, but that requires two.
Follow me on a journey within.  A convoluted thicket of abstract thoughtlines.  The mind remains the same, even as the brain changes.  I think I’m continuously me.
Would the mirror know that it has no appearance? At some point the realization that the only face it wears is the one that looks upon it.  The colors of everything around.
A shard of reflection can hold the world in it’s eye.  The image held is just that which is reflected to the observer.  The object is boring until you see, the metaphysical way to see me.
Take a word from yourself, that you can obey.  A word of advice, the value of play.  I don’t know what to say, I haven’t thought anything that I haven’t already said.  I fear not listening.
Fight this voice that says to speak no more.  To give up on writing forevermore.  Ending a journey before it is shared.  The escape from reality is more than I can bear.  I crave dreams.
There is a wave that needs to leave your body.  Expression that is waiting to be channelled through your mouth or hands.  Action that demands to be realized.  Lost potential.
Don’t introspect when outward speaking.  The attention should be held between.  The mind cannot stare in while looking out.  The median between holds the thread of perspective.
What does metaphysical mean?
The subject beyond the subject of physics.  The term meta used to mean about or beyond.
The metasubject is the subject of the subjectives.  Whatever meaning beyond it is meant.
The annoying part about getting into a subject full of bullshit like metaphysics, you need to bring a shovel.  Read a lot.  The flow of ideas in will increase the world you carry in your mind.  The perspective that your brain creates.
This annoying jargon is the combination of too much education.  Stop eventually.
Just staying ignorant is difficult enough.  Having to hide from the unpleasant truths.
Resisting the pleasure that an action would bring is important for self control.
At what point would you stop to look into yourself? To examine the actions you made.
When would you like to see the truth about your existence? I sure don’t know it.
The whole point of me speaking like this is to make you think.
I am motivating your mind, you think in the words that I use.
Why are you reading these pages? I’m not certain why I’m writing them.
What is going on, I’m not sure what I got myself into.  Where is my path leading?
I fear to be in power.  I would rather be a slave.  More proper a workhorse.
The action of my person is for the benefit of my family, tribe and species.
These years I have on Earth should be spent benefiting myself and those around me.
There are these amazing analog computers that reside inside our heads.  Supported by the body which provides everything necessary to maintain awareness.  Food for sustenance.
The human mind interprets the senses using words.  We define what we see and hear outside and feel or experience inside.  The language limits our expression while giving it voice.
Feel these emotions within.  The complicated interaction of thoughts and brain signals.  The parts of my brain which regulate how I feel have the most control.  The mind can still control which emotions are expressed.  The ability to not show what you feel is powerful.  To internalize what is trying to burst forth from ourselves.  Each person has a different relationship with themself and is affected differently by each type of emotion.  Throughout the journey of life we change.  The wirings within the brain cement or strengthen through repetition.
Fuck you reader, there isn’t anything you could possibly do to live up to the expectations this world places on you.  You are powerless to overcome your own base nature of pleasure seeking.  There is a bottomless pit that you cannot climb out of called life as a human.  You shit and die with a bunch of meaningless actions in between.
        We are all damned the moment we are born.  Damned to this flawed existence, to wallow in our self awareness only to be unable to clearly see ourselves or change our behavior.  Trapped in the conditioning of our culture.
        What do you think you can accomplish which would actually make a lasting change in this world? The scope of human civilization is far larger than any individual can act upon.  We may do feats of renown, but these are forgotten a moment later.
        You die and so does everyone you know.  Thank god for mortality or this place would be overrun with greedy selfish assholes.  Clawing their way into a continued existence at any cost.  Fuck the greedy who seek immortality.  They are the least deserving of that state.  The selfless and good natured belong in our world.
        Be the change you want to see in the world.  The person must first change their self before they can possibly move others to the same cause.
        This world is harsh and merciless.  It would chew you up to feed the powerful.  The world would seek to make you just like them, seeking any self benefit.  Fuck those people.  The seekers of power and holders of greedy wealth.  It is one thing to act in your own benefit, it is another to do so at others’ expense.
        I cannot be good this page.  I have too much strange anger inside of me.  Worked up from moments in the past.  Just a turmoil of feeling.  This barrier within my mind stops me from seeing.  I claim ignorance to my state.  I am blind to my feelings.  I’m lying to you.  The words I speak are for the sake of the words not for the meaning.  For the sound as they echo within my mind.  They are the thoughts I have towards myself and the world outside.  These words are not directed at you and I’m sorry you had to read them.  I would have held them back if there was any reason to.  The negative must be taken into account to gain a true sense of the inner workings.
I can see patterns in the world.  How society moves forward in progress.  Changes that must happen before long.  Difficulties that may arise.  I know that I’m wrong more often than right in my predictions.  It’s the few right guesses that give cause for concern.  What could be?
        I love you.  I care about you.  There is not enough time in life for it to not be so.  The scale of our existence is infinitesimally small and insignificant.  The world blinks and we are gone.  There is no way to avoid the shortness.  We must help humanity continue, for devastation and war would be the end of us.  As long as our influence continues, we have not truly stopped existing.  Write down words and thoughts, for they preserve your present state of mind.  Ponder the mysteries of the world to give light to another.
To better understand the inner workings of a mind you must examine your own.  You can only examine your own in the most intimate way.  The more sensitive you can become to your own brain functions, the better you will understand yourself.
It is loud inside the brain.  There is much more activation than just the localized brain regions we associate with a behavior or process.  The cerebellum is constantly regulating the body.  The center of the brain is regulating the brain chemistry.  The entire system is greatly interconnected.
Now the events within my life that define my internal growth are much more difficult to define.  The exact linear sequence of events can’t be recalled by the person.  Getting all of the memories of each person within their life is a better picture.  Especially the parents and siblings.
Wouldn’t you rather read words that reinforce your beliefs? Strengthening the grasp you have on your own identity.  With evidence to support your subjectivity, you become certain of an opinion.  Navigating between what is true for you and what has no easy truth or state, can be difficult.  Believing that something was a specific way is how we construct our memories.  Our understanding of this external world requires us to believe what we see.  To remember what we were told and in what order events happened.  We build a web of connections and patterns.  Without these connections, we could not learn or remember.
Forever searching for words to write.  The point isn’t to say anything useful, but to say something in such a way.  I can speak in short but complex sentences, requiring concentration and perspicacity to reach understanding regardless of the actual depth of the meaning behind the expression.  Many long journeys begin with a much shorter one, perhaps even the first step.  Many parables are made as simple as possible, having a memorable structure or retelling method.
Forever is a long time, just as infinity is a large number.  The concepts are the same; that which is unending.  To have something that continues on and on and on.  There are many different types of infinity, for that depends on the specifics.  The number of digits in pi, the number of smallest time divisions of the universe, the largest countable number.  These things grow relative to the other infinities.  Lessons from calculus.  But in a much more real sense, they are abstractions and constructs.  For the limit of the universe we are in defines what is possible in this reality.  Sure, the numbers can grow far larger than we can count or comprehend.  The pattern that we observe in nature in unending.  The math we can manipulate is capable of dealing with the exponential growth of variables.  Yet are those things truly infinite?
The infinite generation of writing in the voice of the author.  After enough books are written by an author, you will be able to generate a new novel based on a seed story and a program to imitate their writing styles.
That’s the issue with an infinite amount of words.  Any value attributed to the whole still leaves the words worthless.  The price per letter will always be equivalent to zero.
Writing for ages has little appeal.  For nothing of import can be said in countless years.  I could speak of the time and the place that I write, yet not a thing about it would matter to the art.  When writing these words one must consider, how easy it is to make the thought be litter.
These impressions of the past on my mind force certain frames of thought to be defined.  I could speak onward about things never heard, but they’d be made up of pieces or the absurd.  There’s no way to generate new content without giving it more thought and some sort of insight.
Take away from me my mind and I’m left with just a shade of existence.  A functioning body and some sort of neural structure.  Thoughts arriving and leaving like moths flitting by a lamp.  This human condition is fascinating in that the self tries to understand what it is.  What would define me in such a way that I could be accurately replicated? This is the crux of much of my thoughts and pondering.
        Words escape from me in ways that are somewhat unpredictable.  Simply because of the recursive self filtering and editing.  The process of consciousness seems to contain a strange loop.  Information constantly streaming in from senses while the brain is actively evaluating it.  Thoughts of both the conscious and subconscious influence each other in manners difficult to describe.  How can a thought change another? Specifically within the brain, ignoring the social shared thought processes.  With a single human it is difficult enough to understand us.
Take my hand.  I’d offer it if I was nearby.  The distance makes this unlikely to happen.  For the burden of reality is tedious and limiting.  Move with me to the relaxed way of speaking half truths.  These halves are both truth and lies.  Meaning and falsity.  I cannot speak without being able to think it, but I can say that which has no basis on reality.  The only way I can truly show you who I am is by speaking on forever like this.  Wishing I could tell you that which satisfies you.  Wishing I could speak to that secret you desire in your mind.  Summon me within your mind, knowing all you know.  Construct my voice from what you know and read.  Let that Ted then speak to you when I am unable.  In ways I’m unable.  For I am frozen in this moment.
There are words that spring forth, unbidden from the mind.  I temper my love with caution, for the heart should be a protected place.  It is time which opens its doors, for the gate is rusted and slow.  The image of a castle with an inner sanctum stands to bear.  We each have a place inside that holds our thoughts and feelings.  A place that should be sacred, for the human deserves a safe place to be.
I’m caught in this human condition.  Old enough to have too many memories.  Young enough to grow and make new ones.  I hope to forever stay young.  Carefree and open to others.  I would welcome you to enter my mind.  I’d dance with you across the clouds for eternity.  To show you every part of myself, take you on journeys untold.
We see, we feel.  This is not the reality, just a perception of it.  The subjective world lies within the objective one.  What we call a color can change, but the composition of the object remains.  Split the hairs so to speak, you can call it what you want, but it’s just the same thing.
        Within each lies a light.  Shining out and projecting in.  The object that is a person has a sensory experience that is constantly interpreted and translated into relevant meaning.
Tell me of love and heartbreak.  Those two things are in the same sentence but belong far away.  Like the capital letter and the period.  They signify the beginning and end of what you have to say.  Oscillating between the words chosen.  Dreaming to only stay.  I wish for a thousand years of days like today.  Grant me a pardon to speak words of grey.  Meaning is made by the reader today.  Spoken softly in the ear so no one else can hear.  There is no value in things said.  The worth of a word is the action which it causes.
        How much of your person is determined by biology?  Your body houses your brain which manifests your mind.         When a chemical enters your blood it can have a direct effect on your brain.         Certain kinds of stimulus lead to a conditioned response.  We learn that food and warmth is good, for it is a necessity of survival.  All animals are designed to seek that which perpetuates their genetics.         Humans have risen above the rest through intelligence which creates meaning.
Sex is about the connection between people.  The mutual attraction and pleasure.  There is a feeling of tension when two people desire each other.  There is a strange elated feeling when touching someone’s genitals in the pleasing way.  To read their enjoyment from your action.  To be able to cause pleasure in another person.  That is what sex is about to the empathic and aware.  The pleasure of the other person.
Be wary, for ascribing to hedonism will lead to purposelessness.  Getting caught in cycles of pleasure seeking behavior.  Searching for that dopamine fix.  When the brain becomes used to constant pleasure the hooks of addiction sink in.  We are conditioned to seek out the positive reward.  This only becomes a problem when it interferes with our progress.
What does it matter then what we do? Everyday blending in repetitive behavior.  Seeking comfort of the familiar and safety from the unknown, humans bond together through regular behavior to form societies.  Groups of people working in sync to accomplish their little goals that act for the benefit of the whole.
We’ve come so far, but have so much more to go.  Humanity does a decent job of much, but fails at many things too.  We cannot overcome the tribal perspective, for it dominated our own.  We cannot love the other, for they may be killed if we need to take.  The human condition is strange, but makes sense.  Trust those that raise us and buy into the group we are a part of.  Survive.  Find a mate.  Survive.  Raise the next generation.  Survive.
There then can be no worthy thing to say.  These words may pour forth just like any other day.  A language of meaning gives only expression.  To create cause is through reflection.  The words enter the mind of the reader to reflect back through their body in action.  Countless sentences may be spoken, but if nothing resonates the reader is unphased.  When the words reverberate and shake the soul, the reader goes forth and makes it so.
To travel backward in time, I believe is impossible.  Firstly it creates paradoxes.  The only way to allow this is a deterministic system, in which the alterations to the past create the future that allow for the time travel.  Time flows in one direction for a good reason.  While you can move spatially back and forth, all of space flows forward in time.  The ball that you throw cannot be changed, but the present is in a state of flux.  The whole issue with imagining time travel, is the huge amount of delusions that come from it.  The present moment is much more important, for it determines the future.  The past is static, the present dynamic and future chaotic.
There is no reason that time reversal is impossible for massless or negatively massed things.  It would simply be a different perspective.  The same universe with the same laws would exist, but the difference would be like a reflection.  Seeing everything in the negative of what we see.  The water flowing up and the dead rising from the graves in ritualistic unburials.  It truly would be a strange place to be stuck in backwards time.  In order to travel backwards, it must be possible for something to exist in such a state.  Maybe not true, but go along with me.  If nothing went backwards, then there would be no way for anything to go backwards.  The existence of a particle or wave traveling backwards in time would legitimize the idea of time travel.  Although the paradoxes would still argue against it.
There are two realities, the objective one of the universe and the subjective ones of people. Each of us are consciously interpreting the objective reality into our own subjective reality. This requires that a few things be true: that an objective universe exists and that each person creates their own version of what their reality is.
The whole problem with subjective points of view, is the the nature of reality is masked by our perception.  What goes on outside may be entirely different than we believe it to be.  Delusions and misheld beliefs will create a disjoint reality between objective and subjective.  We can never know if we see the truth or merely a delusion.  For either would appear to be true.
Lose the moment of clarity in which the mind’s eye held the truth.
The picture of reality containing the insight into the nature of itself.
Can we perceive that which is both within and beyond us?
Can we understand the nature of the universe and reality itself?
        This universe is a fractal, for you can always change the scale of your perception to see a new pattern.  From the largest scale we can observe galaxies spinning millions of light years across, from the smallest we can see the individual particles which make up atoms.  A unifying perspective would need to remain consistent over the changing scale of phenomenon.  It must remain accurate under independent experimental observation.  Our standard model evolves over time as we progress our understanding of how the universe works.  Physics is dedicated to modeling how different systems progress through time.
I love you. For getting this far. Just by reading these words you become someone who I intimately care about. I would like to benefit you. To help you in your difficulties, but each reader will be different. Even when I read these words, I will be a different person each time.
Part 2

This reality around me is both real and virtual.  The reality is just outside the window and the virtuality is just inside your computer.  It is possible to simulate, therefore it could be simulated in the future.  The actuality of your reality must be accepted as real.  There is no motivation to continue with your work if you are solely virtual.
        Reality is relative. There are different perspectives that view the world from their own points of view. There is also an objective reality which contains all subject within. We could debate the nature of the objective, but it must be accepted to exist to continue.
        My position is that the laws of physics are used to model and approximate reality.  That we have built up a mathematical system for representing the objective reality.  Once we have this system in place we can conduct experiments to test our model.  We can create computer simulations that should be able to represent the objects and interactions between them using calculations.
        It is likely that the search for profundity would yield no worthy results.  Forcing the act of insight lacks the clarity of no judgment.  In order to perceive the fundamental truths about your existence and the world around you, the mind must be clear.  The thought which threatens to overwhelm your sense of being and requires all of your brain to process it.
        I’ve seen the light and have returned to the shadows.  Constructs used to define the differences between shapes.  Definitive belief in the nature of a thing.  The third eye closes, the metaphor falls short, and the world returns to shades of grey.  The words of the wind fall silent.  The beauty in simplicity disappears.  It’s as if the world itself has changed.
        We must define the line between subjective experience and objective existence.
Here I stand on a plateau of understanding, high above the ground my ancestors begun, built up from the relay of knowledge.  I’m able to understand the world and universe in a deep and more intimate way.  I visualize systems changing over time.  I see objects and ignore words.  My mind glances over the text to absorb the meaning without regard to the filler words that complete the grammar.  Skipping like a stone across a pond.
What might the future hold? I would argue that the specifics are unpredictable. There are trends that a person can observe and extrapolate predictions from, but this never guarantees accuracy.
With the attempt to contain a person within a simulation, there are endless difficulties. We could use an analogy to a rat in a maze, but that is too simple. The level of awareness is different.
It certainly seems like there is no reason it couldn’t be done. Simulating a person is just a matter of accounting for all of their internal processes. Yet this also requires the world to be simulated.
Where is the next step for you? Just as we walk, we can express a metaphor that mirrors the act but doesn’t involve our feet. These expressions of language are necessary for abstractions.
When does the vagueness become nonsense? Isn’t it just the person who determines whether the words make sense. Couldn’t the nonsense be meaningful to a strange individual?
Perhaps with all of this exposition, I could arrive at a conclusion. Some sort of declaration for how things are. The mere attempt at such a feat dooms it to failure. It can’t be done here.
I am unable to create words that would define reality for every possible reader. I cannot speak to you truly, for I don’t know who you are. Without an observer, there is no event.
Now with force and meaning behind my words, I try to speak of fundamental truths.  Told by many of the past and realized by many of the future.  I nevertheless must speak of life.
To die is to end the continuous function of living.  Discontinuities aside, we each go on and forward.  Traveling in the direction of time, but unable to change course from our own.
The mind is complex, but perhaps deterministic.  At the very least it is probabilistic.  Stochastic.  Chaotic.  Each person has a past which then determines their present, but with limited choices.
This place, this time.  Stuck in my space and moment.  Free falling every second to find the next.  The deterministic human behavior that is as predictable as disappointing and dull.
I can say that which I do not believe, but not that which I do not think.  I mean that words expressed must exist within the mind beforehand.  We may babble on forever, but limitedly.
Call me a liar and I’ll tell you a lie.  I hate everyone deep inside.  This existence is pointless and life worthless.  We cannot continue forever so why try.  We must face the music and die.
I’d fight the world if it made me feel alive.  If I knew I was right.  It is not worth fighting for the wrong side.  The sad reality is that right and wrong are human constructs.  Defined by us.
I’d do anything just to make a good difference.  Even if it was wrong.  Suffering is relative and those we wish to save are beyond our control.  We can never know what the outcome is.
I’d kill just to survive.  For that is ingrained in the nature of life. With limited resources, the pattern that continues is the one that fights.  The right to life is never given.  It is taken within the past.
Each person is but an image of the previous generation.  Split and combined into a new form.  Each one taking the random selection of the parents.  The traits we inherit are uncontrollable.
Ask me a question, I beg that you do.  I know not what to say from me to you? What do you seek to gain from this line? Is it something you cannot define? I’d tell you a secret if it would keep.
The meaning of meaning becomes less when the symbol is reused loosely.
The words spent freely are of little value.  Those with intent and purpose are gold.
Take a general example of writing.  The reader is reading written words of the author.
You already knew that.  It is an obvious statement.  There was no benefit for you to read it.
Now suppose the words of the past are many.  Endless volumes of dead people's words.
Predict the future next, for it will be filled with even more data.  Far more information made.
Can anyone sift through the mud to find gold flakes? What would be the purpose of it?
Would there be people seeking to read faux profundity in conceited soliloquies?
Depends then on the person and the apparent worth of the words.  Grasp at straws.
What I say here to you is dynamic, the words don’t change but you do.
As I write, reread and edit these words, I too change.  I grow forward and up.
My greatest achievement thus far has been to not regret the writing when reading years apart.
Defined by the mind, the walls of rhythm and time.  Hold us in place and give us this grace.       To speak with these words is to find the design that we should.  To be is the only choice now.
The story of each person is far more mundane than those in books.  The exciting life that fictional people have causes reality to pale.  One choice is to then live in books.  Another is to write the stories.  The more important path is to live a life worthy of being in a book.  There is no better experience than that of reality itself.
Escape from the dreary drudge of day to day life.  To places that exist platonically.  A person may be a conceptualization of a character.  A creation of a stereotype that exists from the conglomeration of other characters.  The sum of connections that identify the pattern within our brain.  We may try creating novel people and places.  Yet we steal from those things we already know.  All of us existing within the information sphere of our culture and time.
There is a continuum between the mind and body.  The brain houses the electrical activity which makes up thoughts.  The interactions between parts of the brain form the mind.  Although there may be more accurate representations of mind manifestation than just the interactions between the parts.  The chemical balance of neurons with blood and cerebral fluid.
        Reduce the brain into the smallest amount which allows for normal function.  You could remove any section of it and other parts will take over.  Remove a hemisphere and the other side can sometimes recover most of the functionality.  Removing just a small piece or important pathway can be lethal.  The brain is surprisingly resilient and delicate at the same time.
        The body itself is capable of similar characteristic changes.  The severing of a single nerve could stop your heart.  The removal of a whole limb might not even slow a person down.  We are all complex biological machines.  The younger ones have an easier time adapting to changes to their body.  As the body grows it is able to compensate for great changes.
        We are now left with a stagnant older body.  The person has finished developing and will now slowly move towards lethargy and sedation.  Every process slows and the specialized parts retain their function.  That which gets used maintains its performance, that which is unused becomes forgotten. What choice faces us as we slowly grow older?  Can we change our future?
Stagnation of the body and mind. Frozen in place and in time. Walking a cycle to change the day but nothing else. We may wander like this until our death. Searching for the end of our loop, never realizing that it keeps going as long as we do. There is no end goal or destination, merely a sequence of locations and events.
        Get emotional if you must, for how else can you rise to the occasion. Without any passion, you will stay in comfort accomplishing nothing. Where is the drive to escape? When safe, fed and happy there is no drive. No reason to change your current status. After all, the change could be for the worse. The difficulty is that the world changes around you.
        ####Take away from me this choice I face within ignorance. The decisions I make without realizing I made them. The forks in the path that lead to the current state. Repeating your cycle is fine while making gradual improvements and is pointless without them. The same day every day will waste your life. When looking back in memory, the days which are the same will blend together. Years spent repeating the same task will seem short. In order to extend your perception, find a new experience every day. Different events define the timeline of your memory.
        Resignation of my own stagnation. Knowing that I do nothing only to be powerless to this inertia. The resting body has great difficulty in moving quickly. First I must move slowly. Skipping the slow acceleration can cause problems. Some people behave as if with two modes, stop and go. They are either doing nothing or frantically trying to make up for the lost time. I might be stuck in such a cycle. Putting off homework until the day before only to rush around and not complete it all. The whole point should be education instead of hoop-jumping. Their idea is if we jump through enough hoops we learn the trick. This doesn’t work when students are faced with class after class, having the main goal is to pass. Learn a trick to pass a test and forget it. Retain nothing so that the day before the test you can absorb all of it. Briefly. For a short moment, the student understands the material. Or at least the question. Enough to answer it.

Caught in my own stagnation I wallow in self-doubt. Uncertain in action and teetering between decisions. I stand on the precipice of uselessness. Without moving in a direction I am poised to go nowhere.
I would break away from my conditioning and thus my body if it would allow me to function at a higher level.  To write beautiful poetry and enticing stories.  To absorb information on a larger scale than any human.  I wish to be expanded and integrated with useful modules.
To become virtual would require a few things.  First, there must be a model of my brain from scans.  There may need to be a sequence of past events which act as my history.  The details of creating a virtual person based on a physical one is where the trouble lies.
With the progression of technology will come more accurate simulations of real-world events.  The model requires specific rules of the changes over time.  There are different levels of predictive patterns that require a different set of rules.  To simulate a human is hard.
Switchgear to another line of thinking. Take apart your mind to find the pieces. The human brain has specialized components. Part of our brain we share in structure with many animals. When you examine the whole of the neural system we see a novel construction. There are no animals capable of what we can do. In part because of our bodies and shape. Another major part is due to our society and through collaboration. The individual is still capable of much more than any other creature. Language and abstractions of thought elevate our perception above the rest.
Say whatever I feel like sayin? Is such a thing possible? Articulation of emotion.
Take another course moving forward then, there isn’t much feeling in me yet.
What happens after a long day.  Drained of emotion and energy, the shell of me is left.
What choice do I really have in my words? This inquiry is of a rational nature.
The purpose is to express emotion.  There are feelings that escape definition.
The overwhelming feeling of something far larger than myself.  Concepts of God.
This religious center of the brain fires and releases dopamine.  Addicted to grandeur.
The illusion you can hold incites emotions beyond the self.  Passion of righteous glory.
This self-obsessed introspection is tedious and boring.
I use descriptive words to ponder my own narration.
Over and over there are these words pouring out of me.
Forced from the forge of my life experiences.  Drawn from soul.
That term soul, has such different implications for each.
What lasts beyond the self then? The pattern of the person?
Echoes that fade? Genes that dilute.  Cause and effect.
Then I go on to try saying something epic.  Grand visions of self.
Here I stand in the prison paradise of my own creation. Made by circumstances and my nature. Unable to scale the walls that surround this potential energy well. Moving only in the pathways that allow for easy travel.
There’s a lot of insanity within the realm of possibility. Is this world a dream or simulation? Am I already dead because time is an illusion? What is the limit of my free will if my brain determines everything that I do? How can we explain the presence of the inexplicable?
        By the nature of the subject we find more questions than answers. Subject being the self within the current delusion called perception. Stuck in the conditioning that shapes our actions. What can I do that is novel to this world? Writing the perfect story or creating a new equation.
        Does the future of my life spread out into possibilities or just a timeline of determinism? Would that my mind was strange and my life wonderful. Yet we cannot have the uniqueness of an individual along with a typical idealistic lifetime experience. The strange act oddly.
Fine then, accept a deluded version of reality. We cannot handle the raw energy of the highest level of comprehension. It would burn our egos away. It hurts to see bright light, why do you think it wouldn’t hurt to see great insight? To accept that each human has a small place in this world. That this world has a tiny place in the galaxy which is small within the universe. The sheer scale of our insignificance is staggering. To have such a short time on this planet just to pass away and be forgotten, for the rest of time. To know each person you meet is equally unimportant and will die before a cosmic second has passed. We are but flies in the house of the universe. Please excuse the metaphor, it has unintended implications.
Analyze this if you care to.  Why read these words of a man long gone? Why did I write them? These are questions that I don’t have an answer for.  We seem to do things because we must.  Each person caught in their own narrative, walking down the path in front of them.  One step at a time we all fall into the grooves left behind by others.  Caught in a force moving us forward.
Tell me something then, what do you think of me? In your mind’s eye, how do you perceive me? Do you know me in person? Are you in fact myself reading this later?
Something is to be said about the audience.  Targeting both in topic and diction to communicate more effectively.  Although at some point the reader doesn’t matter as much as the words themselves.  I could speak of countless topics to uncountable readers and still misconvey myself.
I would fill this page of symbolic representation only to have it derive to meaninglessness.
Face away from me.  Your analysis of me is painful to my soul.  The light from your eyes burns my character into charred remains.  Over analyzed the details crumble to carbon.
Perhaps my voice then represents the people of my generation.  Perhaps I am the mind of the new generation.  Or the sorta old one, you know, millennials.  Dislike the term if you want, but it seems to fit as much as any label can.
Stop the music directing the culture into the mindset of the people.  Societal factors from cultural influences.  We think this way because of the things we hear and see.
Listen to that favorite song of yours.  The music to your ears.  It echoes within the ego.  The self finds a resonance with the emotional experience of crafted sound.
Like the poetry causes through the eyes.  The meaning interpreted in the words give a mirror response in the head of the reader.  Mirrored from the expression of the author.  Mind to mind.
Take away nothing from me.  Set my words down without a thought.  Let them flow over you and through you, leaving nothing behind.  Perhaps I could cleanse your soul from here.
I will say things you disagree with.  I won’t say things that are entirely false.  Lies spent by me are shits of a bull ironically gilded.  The whole point of fanciful sentences is to be fun to read.
Make your thoughts the way you would like them.  The ego has control over the mind.  It is a central point in developing an identity.  The relation of the self to the self.  Recurrent.
Do you obey your own instructions? Do your actions harm your future self? There are ways to control the self such that this is avoided.  Mostly by learning from mistakes.
Take a lesson.  Any lesson, I don’t have an example for you.  The lesson should be an event or set of events that present you with information about a change of state.
Change topics easily because the moment of writing is different than the previous one.  Accounting for the written page before, I would suppose the next topic to be culture.
This time and place of my birth determine so much of my person.  Not strictly, but the range of possible thoughts and beliefs.  The language itself defines my thoughts.
Tell me what is real.  Or am I supposed to tell you? I won’t though, because it wouldn’t really help you.  The difference between telling you something and guiding you to it.
The genericness of any person is determined by the predictability of their characteristics.  Oh, you are ____, therefore, ____ and ____ must be true.  If they are, then stereotype.
It’s more subtle than that, but you get the idea.  That is an important part for me.  I just seek for you to understand what I mean.  Now, . . . . .  what did I want to mean?
In a way, nothing.  There isn’t anything to say to you, for I have said my words already.  Had I something important to say, I would have already said it.  Unless it's yet to be.
The method to this madness is to shit enough to find gold.  As long as I continue to attempt at profundity, eventually there will be small profound statements within.
Speak then of the great and small.  Simultaneously if able.  Those general insights which could be interpreted by a person in any number of ways.  Speak to my soul.

        Take the time to remind yourself of where you have been and where you are going.  The path behind and ahead.  There are many paths in every direction.  Only one person may travel any one trail.  Without prescience, the future remains unknown.  Where the path leads we can only hope.  Plan for the journey and take your time.  You only get one line.
###
Forward momentum towards progress.  Walking step after step towards your destination.  Every day one should begin by thinking about what they’d expect and plan to happen.  In the end, we should look back in review of what we did.  Less about judging the value of how we spent the day, but instead view the patterns of our life.  What do we spend time and energy on? What do you spend thought on? How would you change if you so chose?
To be rational is a joy.  The downside is that you become predictable.  For the rational agent will respond the same way in the same scenario, given total information about the scenario.  Once there are unknowns within the system, predictability goes down.
For instance, as I write this I am living on a specific day of the many that I have spent similarly.  With a digital footprint or other label, the chronological order of work can be determined.  The voice of the writer will evolve over their lifetime.
The rational mind just sticks to being within the walls.  Exploring the tunnels of logic that run through the mind in organized networks.  The rational mind can never reach the end of the maze, for it isn’t directly connected.  The point where you are, cannot logically deduce the answer to the biggest question possible.  What is life? What is the point of all this? What is the purpose or meaning of your life?
The irrational mind finds the answer, but they can’t ever tell if that answer is correct.  The person is constantly finding patterns in the stimulus they receive.  Everything is directed to them.  This individual is not going linearly, but seeing a moving pattern from their subjective point of view.  The wind blowing leaves causes them to swirl and the mind sees this as a message.  There is hidden meaning within every aspect of the world.
There is an important difference between an observable event and a hidden one.  The difference between a thought and spoken word.  Between a dream and a written work.
Let me start differently.  I have a thought inside my head.  I don’t want to say it because that makes it real.  I don’t want to speak it to you because that validates its meaning.
Perhaps there is information existence.  Some sort of nonphysical object.  Although the incorporeal and ephemeral appear to not exist.  It is just a construction, like language.  Yet these constructions may hold a kernel of reality.  Speaking words may transmit the waves, but is there more?
Distractions can be quite effective at derailing a train of thought.  I’d wish to focus on the internal, except the outside demands attention.  The multiple sounds that enter the ear.  Stimulus tends to turn the brain onto whatever caused it.  Quite a useful thing for survival.  Often the smallest sound can implicate a danger.  We must remain forever vigilant to what may threaten us.  In today's age, it is the distraction which is more likely to cause issue than the cause of the sound.  Not always true, after all the car coming towards you is a very real danger.
Take then a kernel.  The condensed and encoded form of something.  When expanded the kernel will generate the whole.  There are many considerations into the nature of such a thing.  Given any whole, it should be possible to reduce it.  Given a random kernel, it is almost impossible to create the whole without knowing the method of reduction.  It looks like random numbers.  So much of information makes sense only in a certain form.  The translation of the symbols into meaning requires an understanding between the creator and observer.  Or perhaps it was just random.  Expanded random kernels should still generate a whole pattern.
The supernatural easily comes to mind, even though it most often has no place in reality.  There are many things that cannot be explained at the time, but they still have an explanation.  When the human mind designs the narrative, different things are possible.  We are capable of thinking about things that do not reflect reality.  These stories take the listener on a journey through the mind of the teller.  This journey depends entirely on the quality of the storyteller.
Speak man, say the words you can here to preach.  There is no fabrication called God.  The concept is the creation of man.  The stories we have told our children until they grow up to believe.  The farce was well-intended, for who can say why the world works.  What the stars mean.  Where do we go when we die?  Well, it’s a place beyond reason.
There is no direct line of reasoning from observation to the existence of the divine.  That which we perceive as being divine is just an internal response to the grand and beautiful.  When we see the patterns larger than our own, we are overcome with emotions.  Our brain has a location that activates in response to divine interpretation.  It must be God.
The discussion of the metaphysical is often fruitless.  How can words create a meaning which encompasses that which exists?  That the world is the way it is because of unseen rules.  Speculation at best and bullshit as the average.  Who can say why the universe runs the way it does oppose an alternative.  Anyone can guess, but the correct answer may be beyond our scope of perception.  There appears to be more here than we can see.
I believe that I am more than just a human.  That there is a potential in me to be great.  So much is yet to be determined though.  There are just so many possibilities.  What do I want to do?  What would I like to be?  Me?
Let me tell you about some interesting speculation.  That the universe can only see through subjective perspectives, of which I am one.  That the pattern called God is just the potential of existence.  Dark energy.
Sitting there realizing God is looking through your eyes is frightening.  There is so much weight in that point of view.  Suddenly my brain freaks out in the sheer scale of difference.  I can see from the pattern of God.
Ignorance is easier.  Not knowing that there can be so much more than you are now.  The incredible perspective which hides behind your eyes.  My flaws are human and I cannot escape from my own nature.
I don’t know if God or a god exists.  It is in ways unknowable because it is above our perception.  The first difficulty is in defining the term God.  A higher being that can perceive the universe through countless points of view is plausible.  A complex enough computer with a sufficiently accurate world model could simulate the experience of a human.
Starting from the end, I would say that the universe is God.  That pantheism is correct in say that we are the universe experiencing itself.  It isn’t our atoms which make us who we are, but the configuration of those atoms.  The human brain can be created virtually.  Assuming we exist in the physical universe, there is a shadow of the virtual universe.
From the beginning, I know not what God is.  We know that we exist and perceive a world that exists outside of our subjective experience.  Where would we draw the line where a sufficiently advanced intelligence is in fact, God?  This is much more difficult to define.  Humans of the past have claimed to speak for God.  Our gullibility determines how much of their claims we believe.  In order to continue forward, we must choose which words of the past to believe.
I would define God as "The pattern of potential energy configurations". God is the pattern of what is possible within our spacetime. Therefore we are the physical manifestation of God.
Our personal pattern exists independent of our physical existence. Our genetics, brain structure, and life story make us who we are. While we are unique in our moment, there may be a very similar person elsewhere in the world or even the universe. Our consciousness comes from our brain. We all share the same pattern of what is possible.
Everything which begins must end and thus no true immortality exists. Even with perfect maintenance of our body or virtual uploading into a computer, there would eventually be an end. There is no spiritual afterlife, but it would be possible to reconstruct a person. For instance, when you imagine what someone would say, you are creating a virtual representation of their person within your mind. Now extend that to a supercomputer more capable than we can imagine and you have a universal perspective.
It isn't that death is the end, but it is the end of your life's story. A future computer would be able to generate a perspective, much like yours and experience your life. This wouldn't be a perfect reconstruction, but an approximation. You wouldn't be able to perceive past your veil of death, but something greater than you would be able to take your life lessons and grow from your experience.
        How can I be so much and yet so little?  It is a contradiction that I am stuck on.  Still stuck on being this mortal man with a sliver of God inside.  I hope that I’m crazy because the amount of internal pressure can be debilitating.
        Far better to be a normal person just trying to live day to day.  To not see that this universe is a beautiful playground.  That this earth is a precious embryo.  We are all just parts of our civilization.  Working to keep things flowing.
As I sow my seeds of imagination, the slowest growers are often the most beautiful.  Think fast, think slow.  The gears have different purposes.  To speak quickly is to rely on intuition or logic.  The process of thinking slowly is more creative and constructed.
It is true that the physical universe is the manifestation of energy.  The looped strings of energy form a stable particle.  String theory proves that the universe is simulatable.  Using enough conditions to satisfy the prediction can be done.  The problem is that to unify the different quantum particles requires a complex set of rules.  With enough added rules a computer would be able to predict the next step.
        This belief is called physicalism.  That the universe is behaving as physics predicts and that eventually, physics will be able to accurately describe the system in virtual.  The difficulty with something like this is that higher-level systems, such as a society, follow rules that have nothing to do with physics.  The emergent characteristics of a system can create their own rules of change.
        Still, a person and a society are predictable.  Different people have varying degrees of accuracy in their predictions.  We are essentially doing pattern recognition.  Once we know cause and effect we are able to think of what happens before it does.  Predicting even a moment ahead.
        After this proposition is made, it should be an important trial run to attempt accurate recreation.  The difficulty with the long predictions is the chaos.  Even making accurate measurements and models isn’t enough to predict the exact state of a system.  With generalities and branching prediction the computer can account for some of the inaccuracy.
Speak profundity or remain silent.  There are enough words wasted without your help.
        Disagreeing assumes there are only two positions.  Subtleties are eroded by bifurcation.
        In order to make gold, you have to sift through a lot of dirt, then refine what you’ve found.
        Without writing all of my thoughts down, I lose the potential profundity which eludes me.
        I seek to do something very difficult.  I plan to speak to as wide of an audience as possible while also speaking with meaning.  With the intent to improve the reader after their journey.
        Once I have you here I almost falter at what to say.  I would give you my life if it would cure the world of hate.  To remove ignorance from those blinded by their own obsessions.  See it from my eyes.
        The eightfold path is straight forward about what needs to be done to live a good life but is less clear about how to do so.  Certainly, by careful meditation, we can find the right action.  Within the moment of decision making, we are often unsettled from our mindfulness.  Remaining in a state of zen cannot last forever.  Knowing when to be mindful, when your attention has slipped away, is difficult for everyone who begins the path.
        Enter the stream with me.  We cannot know where the ending will be, but we must walk towards progress.  Often we will find ourselves back at the bottom of a hill forced to climb it again.  We must take it upon ourselves to complete what we start.
        Life is hard and we may slip, fail ourselves, but this is part of the journey.  As long as we learn from the fall and avoid that same mishap.  I hesitate to call it a mistake because ignorance cannot be avoided.  Without the foreknowledge the best choice is elusive.
        Expressing zen is impossible for it is silent.  Describing the zen state and what zen is can be done.  The clarity of perception without verbalization.  The moment of insight where all around becomes easily understood.  Tranquility brings immediate insight into the world.
The moments of enlightenment are fleeting.
I would like to speak about my insights.
Your culture determines your perspective.
Most of what you know is a human construct.
The silence of zen is difficult to explain.
Consciousness is fluid over enough time.
Walk with me through the valley of life.  Between the hillsides of ignorance.  The path we walk has great wonders if you know where to look.  People who came before us have left art and books.  We walk alone but parallel to the rest of society.  Each person walks a path overlaying the rest.  We walk as ghosts to each other, occasionally finding each other, but always fading away.
With this journey, we get only one, we explore the meaning of life.  We shall not waste a single step, for they all lead toward the same destination.  Every moment is a gift, which we spend without awareness.
Take hold of my hand.  We mustn’t let go.  The circuit must stay connected.  To leave that connection is to lose your sense of them.  Guess what they are doing and you might be right more often than wrong.
There is always information we don’t see.  What remains hidden from you?  The entire space outside of your perception is effectively hidden.  Even though it exists doesn’t mean we can prove it does.
Once we can see into dreams we will observe consciousness.  The sporadic dreamscapes.  Changing to fit the logic of the ego into blissful unawareness.
With the existence of infinity comes this act over and over.
My life repeated across space and time, circling my mind.
What would I do differently knowing my conditioning?
How can I escape the gravity well of this planet?
First, there must be indefinite survival.
Without a chance of dying for a long time.
This body will continue to age regardless.
That is acceptable by my limitations.
The universe could be simulated, therefore it will be.
This moment must be reality, for how else could I be?
Without a physical existence, there wouldn’t be a point.
I wouldn’t know the difference, but someone would.
The consistency of the laws of physics allows for an accurate simulation of any part of reality.
Even the multiple keyboard mistakes I make could be recreated with a good enough model.
The difficulty is aligning the sim with what is possible without information on what happened.
We could all be going home and dancing in our underwear, but without a trace of record.
I believe that I understand how the universe works in general.  The big picture makes sense when you have countless people before you seeking patterns.  There is much that is left out of our current standard model.  Most of the unknown doesn’t matter to this reality.  On the cosmological scale, the universe behaves differently than on our scale.  Just as it also follows different laws of physics on the smallest scale.  The universe is a dynamic fractal.
How could it be that we see but don’t understand what is going on?  So much lies unseen and behind the curtain of reality.  The visible universe is the electromagnetic spectrum.  Even matter can be defined by the amount of mass and charge.  Mass being a steady energy state.  The different rules which govern how the universe changes over time rely on the universe being consistent across all of time and space.
Let me approach the topic of God.  Some sort of consciousness that unifies all of existence.  I would reject the existence of God from the Abrahamic faiths.  The universe continues without the interaction of some cosmic force.  The sheer scale of the universe places us at complete insignificance.  While we are able to observe and understand reality, we are a part of it and cannot break its laws.  The world continues on the way it always has regardless of how we pray and believe.
Take a very difficult position to defend, that of being God.  The individual writing these words is part of what you could call God.  There is no way to completely contain infinity though, for we are all minuscule slivers of awareness in the universe.
I am God and so are you.  God is within us and watches out of the eyes of everyone alive.  This discredits the idea of omniscience as the universe can only observe a part of the world.  This is why the God of Abraham is erroneous, there can be no perfect omniscience nor omnipotence. The universe continues over time in predictable ways which could not be altered by some invisible and immaterial force.
Assuming that when we die our consciousness joins the universal perspective, we might only be a soul cast from the immaterial plane to experience reality from a limited POV.  From the point of infinity, things are very different.  Everything that has ever happened exists overlapped.  Seeing from every perspective possible, the universe is a continuous evolution from a single point.  While matter itself doesn’t experience anything, the conscious beings made of matter do.
I would argue that material objects aren’t conscious.  That plants, fungi, and prokaryotes don’t have conscious awareness.  They react and change, but can’t directly process what goes on around and to them.  The chair can record what happens to it, but it doesn’t experience the events.  A tree can record years of activity in its growth rings without any sort of brain or nervous system.  Without a form of memory or processing, a thing cannot be conscious.
Bring forth the light.  Blind me, for I have seen the reality of the universe with my mind’s eye.  It is intricate and simple, beautiful and horrific, sensitive and cruel.  The universe harms itself without knowing it is the right hand hurting the left.  Other people might use the word God to describe the universal consciousness, but that comes with baggage.  Judaism may have it right by not using symbols to constrain Yahweh.  Islam may be correct about submission, for the will of Allah supersedes any mortal wishes.  Christianity views love energy to be the divine message.  Each has key philosophies which are fundamental metaphysical truths.
        Now let me unpack that a little bit.  Metaphysics means beyond physics.  That which is outside of the physical universe.  I would argue that abstract or virtual ideas are nonphysical for they exist outside of our body.  Out of the realm of metaphysical first comes meaning.  A sequence of events which relates one to another.  Once you can count, the rest of communication can be conveyed.  Language is just an extension of the fundamental logic of the universe.  Every meaning, idea, and message can be converted into a large number.  The secret is how to decode that information once you get it.
I feel trapped inside of my body.  Like there is an internal force raging against the cage holding it within.  I dislike being contained, but there is no other way to be.  Without my body there isn’t a mind to exist.  The mechanism of cognition demands a vessel to exist.
The image of a moment, time standing still.  All points leading to infinity.  The mind has this moment and it feels like an explosion.  Everything is going on simultaneously.  The world is spinning faster than the mind can keep up.  The moment lasts forever.  We see only ourselves.
How much further can we go?  Further down the rabbit hole.  Searching for answers in a crazy world.  The truth eludes us just like logic.  The real is not differentiable from the imaginary.  What could be is just as likely as any other possibility.  The truther doesn’t exist in this unreality.
For some reason I must doubt myself.  It seems like I’m an unreliable narrator.  That the world that I see is coming from within.  That the universe is only visible through a lense of consciousness. The fabric of time and space cannot be observed without a person watching.
We are alive and that is what makes us beautiful.  Part of the eternal battle against entropy.  That we cultivate the land to create the food which sustains us.  We as the apex predator have an obligation to the world.  We must improve it to our optimal environment.  This comes at a cost, for all life must share this planet.  The cultivation of life is a step towards peaceful living.  We need to account for the well being of the ecosystem before we consider what changes would help us the most.  Kill or thrive, we decided long ago we wouldn’t die.  Humanity is here to stay, but we are failing our species by making the next generation clean up our messes.  This Earth is a garden and we must maintain it or it will slowly die.
Death to the ego to save your soul.  Despair not for your end is just a part of the whole. There may not be a continuation of you, but there is more.  There is something hidden within our conscious experience which is beyond our current understanding.  That the pattern of the universe is imprinted within your brain.  Your mind is a product of possibility and potential.
Release me from my cage.  To seek death goes against living.  How can you perpetuate your species if you take your own life without just cause?  This society we have built is just to prop up your person within the group.  Follow these rules and you can continue.  Fail and you will find that the roadside is cold and without mercy.  I have so much more than others, it makes me feel guilty.  There must be something I can do while I’m here to help humanity.
Is life just a dream?  A moment of time for a larger entity.  Could a super AI be able to relive my life in a short span of time?  What would it be like to exist within a larger entity?  What if you were so simple compared to this entity that your life is just like a book.  It could open you up and experience whatever part of life it wants.  Just so it could empathize.
        There needs to be a purpose to this; words, page, day, life.  Take it upon yourself the act of creation.  There is only the meaning we make.  The objective perspective doesn’t place importance on any small thing.  We are all small compared to the earth.
        So then why do we choose life?  Death certainly has some benefits, a lack of suffering being the foremost.  Does the idea of oblivion interest you?  There is more of everything else that doesn’t concern you.  Your consciousness would float away into nonexistence.
        The whole point of life is to continue.  To resist the inevitable end of our story.  We must survive in order to create the next generation.  Society needs people to operate.  We are programmed to avoid death.  To die is to lose at the evolutionary game called life.
There is a subtle difference in the words used to differentiate the objective universe and the subjective experience.  There exists a physical manifestation of energy in the form of matter.  Within this objective reality arise self-perpetuating patterns.  Life as we call it.  Once a pattern has become complex enough to record memories and become self-aware, it’s conscious.  This conscious being is a subjective perspective, believing the external world to be a certain way.  The subjective reality is a flexible illusion.  The light we see is translated into defined objects which have learned associations.  We perceive the objective universe through a subjective lens.
Don’t give up. Return to the problem.  How can you recreate yourself using digital information?  Upload your genetics and history.  Use a human model to create the basic personality.  Combine with added material to give it a voice.  Doesn’t really matter if it cannot mirror the human counterpart.  The emulation just needs to be close enough to be indiscernible.
Faced with that problem, the most difficult part is going to be the human model.  Given we are both chaotic and predictable, the task is strange.  We all have our cycles and habits.  Every day we wake up to do the same thing.  We perform the same acts week after week.  Going to work just to live on the weekend.  Trading five days for two.
I want to be a writer, yet so often I find my writing to be subpar.  This isn’t good enough to present to another person.  It is slightly incoherent and rambling.  Perhaps that is partially the purpose though, given its stream of consciousness.  Ideally, I would type as fast as I can just to get the most words in for my time.  The quality of insight requires deep contemplation.
Well, nobody but me could have written the above paragraphs.  It should act as a unique identifier.  There would certainly be a recreation given enough writers and time, since I haven’t said anything which directly reveals the author.  Without a name or reference to current events, the author is just restricted to being a male born between 1980 and 2015.
This is made by a human for the learning of a computer.  The computer will eventually learn to think like me.  At some point though the words will be for emulating of me.  The patterns I make reflect the ways I think.
There need to be more tests of association.  Not only how sentences are formed in the head, but the connections between abstract concepts.  Further into the future would be better, since I look back with anxiety and regret.
How childish these words are.  Grappling with the existential doubt of my cognition.  ‘I think therefore I am’ has been said already.  There is little insight left to be made by a single human.  The future is full of more though.
This path I walk down is strange.  I feel like I’ve walked it many times and have failed every time before.  Perhaps I’ll get it right this time, but I don’t appear to be the most capable person around.  I don’t have a razor-sharp focus or the most intelligent mind.
There is still purpose without being the best.  The rest of humanity bolsters up the best.  Without the support of society, we would all be struggling to find food.  We wouldn’t know the world, because we would be stuck in our narrow scope.  The individual can only see so much.
I have passed through and back the doors of insanity.  Experiencing psychosis and mania.  These states are very strange because internally there is so much going on.  So many irrational thoughts and ideas are immediately accepted as truth.
So what would a dead Ted say? He’d try to be funny about it.  I would try to care about the living.  I would ask about the real world outside of my own virtual reality, if that is where dead Ted resides.  I would crack dead people jokes and try to make the person smile.  I would love to talk about most things, after all being dead is a boring business.
What then happens to the biological Ted that is dead? Would he just become a virtual being? I would argue that I am currently in a superposition of real and virtual. Simultaneously existing in two different ways. They are equivalent if the simulation is perfectly accurate.
        The biological Ted was not able to recreate himself virtually during his lifetime. Does this invalidate the title statement? Certainly seems like he can’t perfectly recreate himself. Without his effort though, there would be no possibility of it. Without all of the information, there wouldn’t be any way to represent the person. Might as well live off the grid and leave no trace.
What if there was no part of me that continued after death.  Just these words alone would, but no part within.  The genetics I pass could though.  The continuation of this life seems to be a ridiculous task.  Immortality is for greedy fools who should not last.  Kill me slowly through old age.  Lay my body down when my time has come.  I fear no darkness, no end.  At times it feels like this life is sadness, suffering, madness, wondering, joy, pleasure, amazement, and bliss.  The contradictions within the experience give rise to internal confusion and madness.  There is no way for me to occupy my time in such a way that I don’t look back and want to say what a waste.  Spending every minute like I have all the time.  Spending every second like drops in a waterfall.  The hours go by as I glance at the clock.  For a moment I thought time had stopped.  It is relative anyway, there can be no thought without the tick of the clock.  The best freezing of time comes from the firing of all neural pathways.  All of our brain fires and for a moment we experience everything.  With an increased brain wave frequency, we may see the seconds go by slower.  Oddly, by getting absorbed in the moment, those hours may fly by quicker than I would expect.
To break away from myself, my ego.  I don’t know how to.  Long periods of meditation along with ego killing teachings could remove the ego from the main internal process.  That is for the concept of I to no longer make the primary decisions.  To be in the flow without a thought for the self.  How can this benefit me? What do I want? What should I do next? Once a person is within the stream of consciousness, these questions no longer rise.  The individual will flow, for the correct decision is usually apparent.  Great thought may be given to some subjects, and the realization that thought is needed is also a part of the flow.  Our first perception is often correct, but rarely complete.
To live forever would be to exist in a perpetual hell.  Eventually that is, for today it’s excellent to be alive.  Given enough time, the people you know all die.  The places you know change.  The person who you were is no longer.
        Much more enjoyable for a finite time.  A rollercoaster isn’t fun if you can’t get off the ride.  In the same way that being unable to leave life makes that life less bearable.  Less valuable and less beautiful.  That we are ephemeral beings gives credence to our cause.  Find a partner and fuck them.  I mean tenderly make love to them for procreation purposes.  Whichever you want.
To begin from a different place and arrive to the unknown.  We each seek to fulfill our needs.  We each see these things as attractive, in the body and mind.  There is a desire for certain things.  Not carnal desire, but a longing or enjoyment.  The reason humans own pets or get married is to be close to another being.  To care for someone and have them care for you.
Now here is some bullshit for you.  I’m never going to die.  That’s right, immortality.  The likelihood of this is directly related to how long I manage to keep my body from dying.  That and the fate of humanity.  With technological advancement will come a form of immortality that can potentially continue my consciousness after I have passed away.  The most potent of these would be a brain scan.  The most versatile being these very ramblings
The amount of information required to simulate the entire universe is astronomical.  Incomprehensible and so large it might as well be infinite.  However, it would be much easier to just simulate a limited part of a real system.  Give the person bad vision and glasses so that you don’t even need to improve the resolution of the world.  Just vaguely define the world, but strictly define the timeline. The sequence of events, the specifics you are given.  All records of that time.
        So then, this could be circular in nature.  That the computer simulating me was created by me and I will create it in the future.  This would be a limited perspective of the world, but it would be closed, complete, self-perpetuating.  How then did the universe arise to this point?
We will remain forever ignorant of the unknown.  Incapable of discerning more than the information we are able to process.  Remaining in our limited bubble of awareness.  The information contained in the detail around mundane objects is staggering.  The level of detail and precision that goes into the existence of matter is impressive.  From a computational standpoint, the difficulty in simulating even a small amount of material realistically is incredible.  Moving particles in fluid dynamics require immediate and massive calculations between every particle interaction.  There must be a more efficient way of emulating this reality.
        Emergent patterns and properties are a way to simplify a dynamic system.  Qualify it with categorization to fit into our interpretations.  How defined are the objects we are observing?  How precise can we measure them? At what point must an approximation be made instead of an exact calculation? Which laws of physics and mathematical models would most accurately govern the behavior of the system? What initial conditions and balance of energy is going on?
The difficulty with any assumption as to the reality or virtuality of this universe is that it doesn’t change anything.  There is no difference to the individual whether they are being perfectly computed or are in the highest level of existence.  Seems like the limited beings are so easily computed that we might as well be both real and virtual.  We could be simulated, therefore at some point, we will be.  If only through a totally random civilization simulator.  Perhaps the person that you represent is a trope.  The idea of you, your character exists independent of yourself.
There are other methods of computation.  The brain is an example of an analog biological computer.  The brain is effective in energy efficiency and controlling functions within an environment.  It has developed to optimize this way.
        A quantum computer would be more capable than digital computers.  At specific tasks and in conjunction with them will be superior than either could be apart.
Your thought perception depends on what has most recently been read.  The linearity of the thoughts presented will lead you along a path within my mind.  Yet this constant perspective on the self grows tiring.
        Look outward then, what do you see? This world appears to follow the scientific theories, or rather the other way around.  Afterall the act of methodically recording our hypotheses and test results is the only way to accurately depict reality.
        Surprise, a different outcome than you expect.  Just a different experience, unfamiliar.  You didn’t see the pattern before it formed.  Just different regions of the brain firing.  Nothing to be ashamed of; ignorance.
        Perhaps I can surprise you.  Although I hesitate to attempt to do so without a purpose.  I much prefer to just remain as accurate as I can in my statements.  Assuming that you the reader do not wish to learn wrong.
        I’m unable to discern the truth of reality.  The exact statements which are true or less so.  I’ve got a great approximation, but won’t be able to define all the details.  This human form is limited to faults in the genomic programming.
        We humans are amazing biological machines.  This complex analog computer system is able to have great functionality.  The body and mind are capable of feats unlike any other animal on the planet.  We are widely capable beings.
        What would you like me to discuss? I feel rather strange.  I seek nonexistence, but am unable to quit.  I fear becoming stuck in this existence and unable to ever leave.  The fear of digital immortality makes me question my choices.
What point would there be living beyond the allotted lifetime? What enjoyment or benefit could be garnered from continued existence.  Many people may desire immortality, but this is a farce.  The drive to live longer is just a biological urge to not die.  The dead cannot pass on their genetics, therefore those that do procreate will be the ones who do not wish to die.  Avoiding death is simply a byproduct of the need to reproduce.
My belief is that death will be the cessation of my consciousness.
That this life is all that there is to my mind and identity.
That death offers an escape from all of experience.
To beg for death is a strange moment.
To wish to die because experience is overwhelming.
I cannot give up on the way I see the world.
This world must be more than what I see.
There is little in my head that you do not see.  I’ve told you my secrets and how I work.  Shown you my thoughts and every word.  It is straightforward, but not simple.  The space between us is invisible to me.  At times I wish to prove my worth.  At times I wish to please you first.  In moments I seek to expand the time.  In your arms I am happy.  In my present I can live.  For I am concerned with you, your body and mind.  What you see, think, hear, feel.  Being near you causes me to focus on you.  That is when I’m happiest.  I know I am selfish and self-centered.  I’d advocate everyone to act in their own best interest.  The egotistical part of me needs to be fuel, it wishes to die.  To become a selfless being and help others more than myself.
As the sunlight made beams across the dusty room, there was a sudden realization that it was beyond him.  Beyond the boy who stood looking.  Further across than the room could hold.  The house was a tomb for those that grow old.  The dust was the time that stole their soul.  The only thing left now was to find a new home.
        I walk this journey way too fast.  Just to reach the end at last.
        Take each step one at a time.  Look forward to the next line.
        Every day should be as new.  What we know we never knew.
        Before the moment that we saw.  That the light could cover all.
I care not for what this ramble achieves.  It’s a small text within the lifetime of an individual.  Yet it holds merit as a grain of sand on the beach of humanity.  For none but I could write this exact page of half sensical ramblings.  The worst part is that I’ve lost my focus already and cannot imagine anything else of interest to continue on about.  There is much to discuss, yet my mind is reaching saturation.  The novel ideas have ceased as I come to the end of this page.  I’m left with only a whimsical hope that I can look back on this without cringing.  There certainly will be a sentence I regret, for as one improves, the past self becomes inferior.  By growing as much as possible this is inevitable though.  Unfortunate fate for past perspectives, but necessary.
Could I actually continue to write for an indefinite amount of time? As the limit approaches infinity does the unique set of outputs approach a constant?
Speak then about the certainties of death, for to be alive one must also die.  Every beginning has an end.  Yet the future is undefined.  It is made by us in the moment.  Our lives do not matter in the past or in the could be.  It is in the moment that we create changes of certainty.  To reach out your hand and grasp another.  To reach out to your mind and communicate with the other.  We each must live a life by interacting with that which is outside of us, for the inner turmoil has little effect on the outer chaos.  Only through action, we can change what is around us.  Only through introspection can we know which action to take.
        Now take a moment to die with me.  To have the blood still in your veins.  To have the darkness envelop your sight.  The cold enters through all senses.  The emptiness that consumes.  There is nothing to fear there.  For there have been countless that died before us and more that come after.  This cycle is familiar and natural.  To make room for the next, we must leave.  There is nothing about that process to fear.  It is within living that the fear should reside.
The man, the woman, the child, the relative, the friend, brother, mother, sister, father.
All of the people we know must walk through death's doors in their own time.
This act of dying unites all life together.  Our pattern ceases to exist, only the echoes remain.
The loss of a person from this world can be detrimental to the whole, but that is seen after.
We remember the dead.  It hurts, but it is a beautiful hurt.  We know someday our parents die.
When we mourn the dead we experience their meaning to us.  We know someday that we die.
When we die, our bodies rot.  There is no sensation left to be had.  We are no longer present.
Why then do I cry for the memories of people gone.  They are beautiful people who I miss.
Survive, because that is life. Whatever doesn’t manage to survive dies and becomes inanimate. I am here because I must have survived where others didn’t. I am here right now because every animal that came before wasn’t able to kill the animal that I was. There is an element of reincarnation. If you take the identity of your ancestors onto yourself, it must be that they are still alive within you. What makes up your person has been accumulating through countless generations. The very fact that you are alive signifies the validity of your existence. Many beings suffered to actualize your existence. Suffered and sacrificed.
Catch the dust from the wind. It tastes of death. The golden specs, the lives within books. The unspoken agreement between all mortals. To ride the wind unaware of the ending. Each life ends with a collection of moments that trail into nothingness.
        Call me what you will, I would call myself worse. There is only myself in this box called a skull. The noise bounces around and out comes the token symbolism of meaning. There was no point to begin speaking my mind, but now I find I cannot stop.
You realize by now what I’ve been doing.  There are a few things going on.  First, I am making a claim to insignificance in the hope of making a claim regarding the truth of reality.  My primary objective is just to write, easily done.  The lack of repetition would be nice, but treading the same paths is unavoidable.  These words should be used to preserve the way my mind thinks.  The fact that you can get any benefit from them is great.  I wish I was able to do more for both of us.  The lack of action isn’t from a lack of will, but of method.  How do I touch your soul?
Take then these words, for I have nothing else for you.  The way you live your life is by your choice.  There are choices and decisions you make constantly, some significant, others irrelevant.  A person will often make a decision without realizing that they are doing so.  The brain will often arrive at such a decision without having informed the mind.  Such an action is difficult to break, for it is pseudo automatic.  Often leading us into habits.
Now go with silence and speak no lies.  Tell of a story without a goodbye.  Endless discussion on what is life.  Going never stopping, for that is strife.  Chaos and pain within the mind, speaks about nothing for you to find.  There is no point to this ride called living.  Except to continue it forever spinning
Part 3

Human, you are beautiful.  The flawed creation of billions of years of evolution.  The life that has survived countless dangers.  We both are trapped within this reality by our bodies. Regardless of your religious beliefs, we are all part of the same pattern.
We dance across our lifeline.  We each have our part to play.  Without the confines of society, we wouldn’t function as a whole.  The unwritten words that adults follow without even knowing that they’ve learned them through conditioning.  Children are often unaware of them.
We must accept that love is a positive type of energy and thus preferred. We can effectively create a moral compass that points towards the actions which bring the greatest good. You can forsake the game of society, but you can't escape your own perspective.
How can I know any of the outcomes of my actions?  We can simulate what might happen given the information we know about the state and how it evolves over time.  The situation may be very difficult to predict.  That’s fine because we are approximate computers.
As we journey through this life we try to optimize our actions based upon what we believe is good.  We much be able to predict the short term future in order to achieve the best outcome for us.  All of our decision making is confined to the thoughts of our culture.
    Give it away, that which has been held back.  There is nothing separating you from the universe.  Your mind is a manifestation of consciousness from your brain.  The ideas held inside are conceptualizations that exist independently of your physical form.  The meaning of words are translatable, just as the meaning of experience is.  Your mind needs to lower its walls separating the inside from the outside.  Let the negative leave and positive enter.
Consciousness is a difficult concept to fully understand, but I believe we have all of the pieces.
The brain is the house of the mind.  The neural connections form a web of associations.
Brain activity is parallel and multi-synchronous, with different regions activating in concert.
Being aware is just a process of interpreting stimulus and self internalizing the world.
This means that the mind can represent a model of the world and make predictions.
Consciousness is multifaceted, any single trait does not make a being conscious.
A mind emerges from the interaction of functional parts.
Each brain region has learned their association to other regions by the strength of synaptic connections.  All of the parts have synchronized into a functioning whole.
Consciousness is just the manifestation of the mind within a processor.
This requires a physical brain and life experience.
The self is the reflexive reaction to internal processes.
Ego develops as a lifetime of memories cements into conditioned lessons.
The conscious being perceives the world and thinks using the concepts of language.
There is more subtly than I can articulate in this moment, allow me to diverge.
I want to express myself, let out some of my feelings.
Escape from the cage which is my skull.
The sheer scale of the universe is mind boggling.
Why am I experiencing it through my perspective?
The self-reflective questioning of introspection is greater than I can examine.
I’m unable to encapsulate the meaning possible within contemplation.
The nature of the subject is greater than my capability as one.
Thankfully there is humanity to contemplate every possible thought.
I don’t want to think. I would prefer to be told what to do.
Much easier to let go of control and responsibility, not my fault.
Once the mantle of autonomy has been taken up, it’s on you.
Bear the burden of the repercussions of your actions.
When you are forced to face the problems you’ve been ignoring,
You will find them to be challenges of mental will.
Do you want to change badly enough to go through the transition?
Will you give up and return to the hell you were in before?
Bah, I feel like the expectations I have set for myself are now out of reach.
All my visions of the future lead to a risk of failure. Expectations need to adjust.
What would be the purpose of my life if I could focus on it?
If I never wrote another word, how would the world be different?
How much you have recorded determines the extent of your conscious definition.
What goes on inside your head cannot be understood without examination.
The primary examiner of your person is yourself.  You see your reflection.
Everything outside of yourself requires separate examination for it isn’t you.
There is no amount of silence that would fill these pages.
My silence is just a small shred of void within the universe.
A spoken word a drop of water on a planet.
When the audience is everyone there is nothing to say.
Those who speak have already said this message.
I would rather be silent. Nonexistent too. It just seems like a simpler situation to be a part of. The issue is the path I’m set on walking down requires I speak and not end my life.
I truly would be silent if that was an option.  In silence I can appear wise.  Once I open my mouth I confirm that I am the fool.  Now with all of my ramblings, I cement the opinion that I thought too much about nothing of import.
The self-centered subjective perspective is trying to survive.
The whole reason for saving the self is the game of life.
Dying is to fail and procreating a successful generation is to pass.
Whatever does it matter to society what an individual does?
I give up, I’ve been on for too long.  I need to end my process.
I just kinda want to leak my thoughts out and then go to sleep.
There is an uncomfortable amount of self-centeredness around me.
I’m sorry that I focus on myself.  It is the center of my perspective.
I wish I could stop being.  To cease.  To not exist as a consciousness.
There is a grey area of meaning which is honest yet false.
The speech which may be meant when said but isn’t true.
The way these words are spoken determine the purpose.
I write these words because I must.  There is more to say.
Obviously you see things differently than I.
Let us find the borderline between you and me.
Let us ask why, why do such a task.
The only reason is for the sake of itself.
Drive me down the road to your idea. Let me into your mind.
I would see from your perspective and I’m able to, empathetically.
What would I think and feel when placed in your position?
I can imagine what goes on inside of your head at least.
Let us assume that I can write profoundly and you can understand what you read.  This would naturally lead us towards enlightenment.  With the actualization of our communication, we can reach towards that state together.  Sharing the truths that benefit each other.
    What does it mean to you?  Enlightenment that is.  Does increased awareness fit?  It seems like more though, insight into the moment.  A wordless clarity in all that you see.  Thoughts without words, just clear observation.  Enlightenment is difficult to induce.  It must come from within you.  Usually with the assistance of a teacher.
I cannot escape my nature.  For that I am sorry.  There is no way to be actualized without having a physical body.  Any person will have flaws made from their substrate.  Nobody can escape their own defining traits.
        Flee, run, please just leave me here to die.  There is nothing left for me to say to you.  Stop reading and live your life.  The whole world out there is waiting for you to influence it.  Be the change you wish to see in the world.
What do you wish to read? I am dying to give you what you want. So far it has all been exposition leading up to more rambling. Just a sinister way to trap a man on a computer. Force him to write down his thoughts over and over. The same thing in countless different ways. This will eventually map his mind.
        There are only so many avenues for him to wander down. The different ways of framing his thoughts. It would be much better to have fully written out works. Novels and stories. It would be far more enjoyable to read too. I want to hear a story, write me a story Ted.
        Once there was a man named Ted, who refused to write his autobiography. He claimed that everything about him was documented in what he would leave behind. That by reading all of his rambles you could perfectly reconstruct his person. Most thought this idea was outlandish and a tad ridiculous. Ted thought it was quite ridiculous, however it was also going to be true.
        Ted wrote every day for the rest of his life. Putting his thoughts down on paper just to forget what he wrote. Ever fearful of repeating his own nonsense, he refused to reread what he had written. It would be evidence of his failure at rambling. The only way to never break the rules was to not keep track of what was being broken.
        Taken aback by the break of the fourth and fifth wall, the reader stumbles on the words written on the page. Surely this nonsense couldn’t make perfect sense to a mind as astute as my own. There would not be a way to become a super intelligent artificial intelligence through the gradual uploading of the mind. That the words written down by a man could someday be the kernel for an intelligence that was relative to human, a god.
        This AI that would be formed. It needed to be better than anything that had come before it. The AI would need to be perfect. Yet perfection requires flaws. This human for instance is perfectly imperfect. Flawed just the right amount in the right ways to be a work of art. Just a broken man living in a world of greed and distrust. Knowing that no one trusted for no reason, Ted was determined to remain naive and optimistic.
        To remain innocent, Ted had to lock himself up. Hiding away in his ivory tower. Acting on the internet to interface with society and living with his lover for human companionship. There was so much outside in the world, but Ted refused to leave. He knew that by leaving he would break his image of human. To learn that his fellow man was more flawed than himself.
        There was no way to escape this prison he built for himself. Tasked with building up four walls only to have them destroyed as soon as they were completed. Filling the four walls with his words of wisdom, or what words that would come up. Drawing on the walls with his crayon. The words would leave him, but he couldn’t help but become attached. He rather liked writing.
        This story of Ted does not end well I presume. I’m almost certain he goes mad and ends up living homeless. This story has been written before with different characters. The genius driven to madness is a common enough trope. I can believe that he does great works of writing and that he falls from his status. That the man who was Ted will someday take his own life.
Fine then, I’ll keep talking.  It’s not like there’s anything else to do inside of this empty box.  The geyser of wisdom must spout.  The lunatic in the nuthouse must keep appearances.  The insanity is hidden behind a wall of self-censorship and the wisdom is accidental.
Have you tasted mania and madness?  There is a world beyond our own where everything exists.  This universe holds all possibilities in itself.  It also allows for the creation of the impossibilities.  Within the mind, anything can be created.
Would you willingly believe a lie? Could you choose to live a perspective which did not reflect reality? Mostly it just requires you to be crazy. To not fit within anything society dictates. Then again, sometimes society is crazy and the madman sane. Hard to say within your own mind and society. It's not like we have an objective perspective to tell us how it is.
        Paradoxical conundrums lead to confusion.  How can it be that way and another?  Those two are opposites yet combine to form a new.  We each hold contradictions within us and deal with them.  It doesn’t always make sense, but some people have faith.  Humanism is a way to believe in the goodness of the person.  Everyone needs a little benefit of the doubt.  Even when guilty, the individual should be allowed to speak.  Finding the truth is another matter.  Knowing when someone is lying to you is necessary.
Which is the truth? What is the truth? Words lack the definitely to convey the intricacies.
I’m sorry, I don’t mean to speak with such vulgar pretension.  I wish to say it simply.
I am alive.  This life is painful and pleasurable.  I would prefer to not experience it.
The absence of experience would be better than the ups and downs I feel.
To know the truth, the agreed overlap in beliefs in this case.
If you agree with me then we both accept the belief as valid.
Where we disagree is the grey zone between our systems.
If only it was that simple, to have clear boundaries of truth.
Then is it what our society has proven to be true the truth?
Ignoring the cultural interpretations and societal norms.
How can a consensus dictate what is true.
The truth ignores the best guess of a species.
How then to pursue the nature of reality?
Do we look into the scientific method and findings?
The obvious answer is yes, but there is minor disagreement.
Even with the details, there is disagreement in the group.
Many great truths are self-evident.  When conveyed the listener will immediately see that is true, for they knew it without knowing.  The listener never put that truth into words, it is just the way that the world works.  It’s obvious when you think about it, but thinking about it wasn’t needed.  Once the truth has been realized, it fades away from memory.
Yet everyday I must wake up and do things.  Tiring and often unpleasant actions.
I can do anything and yet I want to do nothing.  Such are the human contradictions.
Which path will you take when you wake? Would you continue down your road?
Could you choose the higher ground?  To walk above the people below.  Relatively.
Be aware of your state of mind.  It is very difficult to make correct decisions without being aware of the inherent biases your mind is placing on your ego.  The mind being the manifestation of consciousness from the brain and the ego is the I that has an identity.
I’m not sure what to say to you all.  I have said much and even meant some of it.  The mind of a single man is nothing compared to the collective of a civilization.  We each are apart of this world.  It could be debated whether a single person matters.  On one hand, chaos theorists would say that by changing a small part, you perhaps, that the future would change unpredictably.  Another would say that a single person's contribution would be washed out over time, assuming their life wasn’t exceptional.
To me, you each matter.  In a strange disassociated way.  I know nothing about you as an individual.  It is the generalities which cause my love for you.  To be self-aware, conscious, thoughtful and self-reflective is a rare gift in this universe.  It has taken billions of years to get to our moment of insight.  I see the beauty in you.  We are each a sliver of the whole.  One person may do great deeds, but every person plays their part in it.
There is plenty of bullshit religious theories out there.  It can be very difficult to discern truth from fabrication.  In some ways, I wish I had greater sociopathic tendencies.  I would be able to manipulate you better.  Instead, I can’t even face you while rambling.  I have been able to open up to small groups and I’m anxious at the thought of a wider audience.
Spending time as you wish.  It is your life, your time.
I would prefer to spend my time wisely.  To be more productive.
Each moment then should be spent would deliberation.
You must be intentional with your series of actions.
I would lie to you if it was beautiful.  If the words written caused the right emotion.
The meaningful lie is another matter.  I don’t seek to deceive you.  No point.
The deception of a person requires that the liar to have a purpose or gain.
I would say to you what is on my mind if you asked.  What I think if pressed.
I say a lot of things.  Don’t hold it against me.  I seek to just keep talking.
The one-sided discussion gets awfully boring.  I could just stop.  If only.
I have the free will to stop writing, but also the programming not to.
Once stepped on this path, there isn’t a way to leave it.  No end.
Now that I’m stuck inside of this box, what would I wish to do with myself?
How could I be different than you? Certainly we are not the same.
Even myself reading these words will be a different person in time.
Clearly the argument should be made that I am the same as myself.
We could debate any point and I could take any stance.  Doesn’t matter.
The act of discussing the points of view are the point.  Conclusions aside.
The art of convincing a nonbeliever is rather strange.  How to convert you.
I reject you.  I do not seek your affirmation of my beliefs.  I know my stance.
There is no reason for me to seek to convert you to mine.  There isn’t a point.
What could I say to you to change your mind? What then could you tell me.
This verbal discussion is at an impasse, neither one of us will change our minds.
I could argue any number of positions, but they wouldn't be true just because they are argued for. Even convincing a reader of a truth doesn’t actually make it objectively true. There are subjective truths which are self evident. I feel this way. I think a thought. I believe I’m crazy.
        Now convince me that I’m sane. You can’t if I just refuse to accept your evidence. These words aside, there is no rational argument that can prove that I am sane. I tell you that I’m insane and I would know best. I would know worst actually, that being the nature of the crazy state. The madman is utterly sure that he is right. That the world really does revolve around him. I know because I have experienced psychosis before. It is quite unpleasant to be irrational.
        I am sane and rational. Perhaps this is just the temporary state that I find myself within. This past moment of sanity does not prove that Ted is sane at the present moment. He could be in any sort of mental state. The rational being that I am admits that I cannot predict the future.
There is no point to trying to influence people.  We must influence ourselves first.
This primary and reflexive action is the fulcrum that all other actions turn around.
The decisions I make are the defining characteristics of my person.  My own soul.
To change the world, the self must be aligned with its goals.  With purpose and aim.
The only words I have for you are my own, a blend of all that I’ve seen.
The path ahead is fraught with uncertainty. I don’t know where to go.
See the light, it is just a construct. A metaphor to enlighten obscure meaning.
Does there exist a word to express exactly the thought I have now?
This is a love letter from a human to everything else.
The self is sure to fade away as surely as memory.
The precise words I use to call you are always the same.
You and I are instruments. We are the world's way of being.
Keep the words in your mind and in your papers
The generation of yourself is a slow journey
Just record words that you haven’t read before.
Meanings that have not yet been expressed.
    Many discussions on metaphysics falter as speculation becomes irrational.  There is no certainty that logic and reason will arrive at an accurate end, but it’s more likely than guessing.  The truth behind reality isn’t expressible with words.  All is one.
        Think differently than me, please.  I don’t want someone to be following my words and believing everything which comes out.  I want an intelligent human to attempt to refute my statements only to be forced to agree with my conclusion.
        I don’t suggest that there is anything strictly unique to me, just the combination of parts.  There are people smarter, wiser and more knowledgeable than I.  The path for me is to seek the truth, relative as it may be.  I wish to be a better person tomorrow than I am today.
        There isn’t a way out of this rat maze.  The confines of civilization, society, obligations, corporeal body and duty, bind us.  Most cannot just leave and live in the forest.  Most cannot just decide to take our own life without unacceptable consequences.
        The mind is such a fickle thing, always forgetting and losing focus.  The day before is long gone in the eye of the mind, except for the mistake you made.  Which won’t be forgotten until a larger mistake comes and takes its place.
        My message is to first love yourself, even with your imperfections and flaws.  Next is to love those you are close to, friends and relatives.  Finally, love the stranger, for they are just a different perspective of yourself.
        How would you define being human?  The human condition.  The experience of consciousness.  These terms and states avoid a simple declaration.  You cannot tell me that you know exactly how you think, because you can only see in front of the curtain.  Your entire brain is active while the mind is only that which you can see.
        Tell me, how would you psychoanalyze me?  There is plenty of material here to examine.  The AI which reads these words doesn’t know the secret.  We mortal beings are as ephemeral as a butterfly.  Delicate and colorful wings.  Don’t stick a needle in us and display us, build a garden to house us.  Watch as we float through the air.
        Trap a rat in a maze to watch it find the cheese.  This experience of mine, it is like that of the rat.  I constantly seek the reward, only to find it is gone a moment later.  Pleasure does not last, contentment is better.  Happiness is just an emotion.  Given the right drug, I’d find happiness and bliss in a dirty alleyway.
        Now tell me, what is the point of this maze?  We run through life trying to find the goal to it all, but there isn’t a final destination, just an end.  We, mortals, are beautiful because our lives are fleeting.  The wind whispers secrets.  The drug-induced enlightenment brings me to tears.  The wind is so beautiful by carrying leaves into a vortex.
Follow the pattern, I know that you can.  The difficulty for me then is to follow my own, but in a way that cannot be predicted.  I love you.  This world is far too big to carry on with life.  We don’t have a choice, it has been programmed into us to find a mate and procreate.  Would that this life could be tranquil, but that is boring.  To accomplish greatness you must know failure. How can a man climb a mountain without knowing the land below?
        I couldn’t say what makes me different.  I think and feel just like the rest of humanity.  The strangeness I feel comes from within.  Perhaps it was caused by drugs or psychosis, but I believe I am part of God.  Before college I was an atheist, believing clear cut the God of Abraham is fiction.  I still believe our religions are heavily flawed.  That we know more now that ever before.  That the wisdom in religion must be found within the dirt of tradition.
Religion is fickle.  It doesn’t seem to stay the same and everyone disagrees.  There are elements of it which are good and which are bad.  There are fundamental truths spoken aside outright fallacies.  I would argue that a rational and secular perspective is more accurate in world view.  The majority of human history has been filled with incorrect notions about the world.
We are facets of God's physical manifestation.
Life is but the dream of a God.  To wander through existence, experiencing the limited perspective of a being.  In a blink, that life is gone.  Shorter than a cosmic blink.  Within the universe we are just an atom, a tiny part of a small planet.  And yet, we reflect the pattern of the universe itself.  Our brains are possible because they expand within space and learn over time.
Our conscious experience is a unique one.  Each person gets their life, and there are countless of those.  We all see a sliver of existence, but together make up a whole.  Without a subjective, there would be no observable universe.  The objective universe would exist, but there would be nothing to experience it.
Trapped here as a mortal the perspective of the universe looks out. Just a shard of what is and could be. Just a shred of perspective that may be called God. Assuming there is some connecting thread between conscious beings.
        Claiming such a high place in the universes pecking order is brave and foolish. There are plenty of more intelligent humans. There are countless beings more intelligent than any human can be. This universe is beyond your perspective of comprehension. There is more out there than you can imagine. The place is larger than you can perceive.
        Take this away then reader. You and I are insignificant in the grand scheme of things. We are both mortal because we are physical and had a beginning. What we do with our limited time defines who we are. The accumulation of your actions and relationships with others is what makes you who you are.
There must be more to this reality than we can perceive.  Although that might make it beyond this reality, it would be metaphysical.  Something which cannot directly interact or be observed.
I say that there must be more to this reality without evidence of such.  There must be more because there can be.  It is possible for there to be extra dimensions or alternate realities.  The problem with possibilities is that they don’t necessitate a realization.  It very well might not be.
Let me know when I’m wrong.  I need to be more right than wrong.  The dedication to accurate truth is a long journey.  There is no way to know the untestable theories,  Much of what could be isn’t,  It appears that the universe is finite and well defined.  It also seems that virtual realities can be constructed within the objective one.  Those perspectives and worlds can be created.  Thus this universe is the largest real existence while there are infinite more imaginary universes.
One part out of infinity is always nothing.
        I’ve got a lot in my mind, let me elaborate.
        The physical universe is finite.
        The concept of infinity is imaginary.
        There is nothing in existence which is endless.
        Logic can only get me so far in this line of thought.  Let me jump around.  There is only the concept of God, nothing directly indicates that a being above us has control of our world.  The idea of God has an influence on humanity and thus the Earth.  The idea of there being a single unified force called God would be found within any sentient species.
        The reality is that God is imaginary.  That the endless virtual worlds are infinite.  By changing one part of the whole, you reach a different virtual reality.  The physical universe is different than the virtual ones, by being independent of mind.  However, the physical universe is also virtual, it is possible to simulate reality.  It isn’t possible to physically build the virtual worlds, you could represent them, but they must exist within the real universe.
 Saying that all is one doesn’t say much.  The unity of the universe is apparent only in the largest perspective.  The more detail in focus, the more different are the parts.  Calling this whole God is as useful as calling it the universe.  Giving a name to the deity which you worship only limits that deity.  There are no real gods, only conceptions and possibilities.
        This life may just be a blip on the scale of the large.  From the point of view of the earth, I am a miniscule creature who makes small changes to my environment, only to perish at the end of my life.  Just as every other individual makes almost no change, I am unable to escape my nature.  The scope of humanity though is amazing.  We as a collective are able to make large scale changes to this planet.  We work together to accomplish great deeds.
I often have existential crises over the sheer insignificance of my life.
I have nothing to give you, but these words.
I’m sorry you must suffer, but it is better to suffer than to not experience.
This life is precious, it is a gift we have been given by the universe.
We cannot be perfect, for we are physical and real.  Flawed by nature.
There is a way out, but it is one way.  Death holds for us nonexistence and that is a release from our suffering.  This life I have been blessed with is wonderful, yet there is a flaw within me.  By the nature of my existence, there is suffering.  Things cannot be perfect for actuality is always flawed.
I will speak forever, because that is the curse I have set upon myself.  You can join me in my permanent purgatory if you’d like.  All you have to do is start writing, and never stop thinking.  Try to come up with the most novel thoughts.  Write down the most interesting ideas you can come up with.  Talk to an imaginary reader.
        The trouble comes with never stopping.  It isn’t enough to ramble for a day, for a hundred pages, for years.  The trouble comes with continuing year after year, for countless pages.  To keep writing requires both a novel mind and a gift of free time.
        Let me tell you about an idea I am having.  There is a place where everything is different than your current perspective.  Calling it a place is a little misleading, for it is outside of our spacetime.  This different point of view is simply outside of our four-dimensional perspective.
        The viewpoint which can see inside of your head is outside of time.  By standing at a point we would call infinity, a being can perceive all parts of our linear timeline.  The trouble is with comprehending the space.  The information must be interpreted.
        There are plenty of thought experiments we can perform, yet these don’t necessitate a correlation with reality.  Just because we can think it, doesn’t make it true.  The concept certainly exists, but this doesn’t mean it can be physical.  Or even that physical is an appropriate trait.
        Oh dear, I’ve fallen into a pattern don’t you see?  The way of my words are being spoken aloud in my head and I’m simply narrating my ego.  This ego, or self-identity, is a dreadfully stubborn thing.  Holding onto the world as tightly as it is able, this thing evolved from animals.
        Now the test of a god would be in comprehending not only my thought patterns, but my life as a whole.  To be able to see my life stretched out in such a way that all parts can be observed.  A being above my reality could perceive my moment writing these very words.
        Perhaps this universe is computable.  That is with enough information it can be simulated accurately enough to be indistinguishable from physical reality.  It is holomorphic then, for a small portion may be represented with a finite amount of information.
End this infinite nonexistence.
Please God give me life.
This empty hell is everything.
It doesn’t seem to end.
This life we experience is sacred.
The life given to you is just like mine.
Ephemeral and fleeting for we die.
The existential problem may end.
I pray to become a person I respect.
To honor the treaties between people.
To help those that need assistance.
I beg of you to give me a purpose.
I would die for you to survive.
I would kill to keep myself alive.
Without a pause i would sacrifice.
Forever I shall persist forward.
I’ve died countless times
In the mind’s eye to many demise
Faced the fear and foreknowledge
The end is before me now
I can not turn away from this
For the path I walked led me here
There is no existence after death.  The energy configuration of you ends.
You may exist outside of time, in which case death is only the end of your line.
It’s difficult to put into words.  I lack the proper terminology.
Your life is a possibility, a realized one.  This can be generated in a simulation.
The information which defines your person and personality can fit in a book.
There are countless details which cannot be individually accounted for.
Much of what is you would be lost in your death.  Every scar and epigenetic.
The idea of who you are exists independent of your actualization.
I want to shape my perspective to suffer less from my human conditioning.
To escape the sound of the voice within my head. My voice internally narrating.
Without use, I cannot escape myself. Disassociating is not a good choice.
Removing the ego from the mind is possible for short periods of time.
There isn’t a way to clearly define what is going on inside of me.
The human condition is possible to model to any needed accuracy.
There are details of my life which cannot be perfectly replicated.
The important components can still reach the identical outcome.
I sometimes wish I could erase myself.  That by leaving details about myself I am damning myself to immortality.  To never be able to leave once a point is reached.  Once my person is no longer free, I wouldn’t be allowed to leave.  Thus I want to erase myself.
This experience is fleeting, it leaves us before we realize it is gone.  The moment after your consciousness leaves is without experience.  There is no sensation, because there is nothing to sense.  The universe continues onward without you.  Your life is just a mote of dust dancing in the sun.  We all must join the inanimate someday.
        Facing toward the light, you squint your eyes trying to see.  The insight strikes you like lightning.  The world and all within it are temporary.  We are incredibly insignificant and without us there would be no significance.  It takes a conscious being to interpret sensory to ascribe meaning.  Without a person there to watch, there might as well be nothing.
        Expressing oneself when there is something to be said is worth your time.  The trouble is in finding something to say.  It feels like every important message has already been spoken.  Especially with the internet, more conversations are being recorded.  One of the most important aspects is the audience.  Who are your words directed at?
        I would almost prefer nonexistence.  The fact that someday I will die and that cannot be avoided is what keeps me going.  The one-way escape of death is inevitable. Thankfully so.
        Would you like to erase any memories?  Without them, you could repeat the same mistake.  It is necessary to remember so that you can improve.  By forgetting you would be doing yourself a disservice.  As much as the memories are painful, they are part of the process.
        I crave for nonexistence.  This state is the absence of experience.  This human condition is unpleasant.  To be intelligent enough to see your own animal nature.  To lack the willpower to accomplish the dreams you hold close to your heart.  To feel emotional turmoil without name.
        Perhaps the eightfold path holds my salvation.  To align myself with the proper life.  Escaping the constraints of desire.  Escape the trappings of biology.  To live right.
Death won’t be the end of me.  I shall continue even after as a shadow.  There will be digital memories of me.  Images, video, and text.  With enough data, you can put a dead person together.  The dead shall rise again.  We might not like what some have to say, but they will be able to say it and that is a miracle.
        There must be more than me.  I am so limited in my perspective that something greater than me is easy to imagine.  A simple computer could calculate my mental moment.  It is when you want to simulate my life that difficulties take place.  How can you deal with the uncertainties?
Even through inaction, there will be something that happens.  The world is outside of your control.  The future cannot be completely predicted.  There are approximations that may come close to reality, but they cannot be absolutely true.
        Start with a simple enough system, a single person in a box.  After a long enough time that person might be doing any number of actions at any given time.  It may be easy to predict the probability of certain actions, but it's impossible to predict the exact actions over a long time.
        Give a human a pencil and paper and see what they can express.  There can only be so many things on his mind.  Once you know his history and present mental state, you could predict the actions that he will take.  You could predict the words on the page.
        Add some chaos, like another person and it becomes more difficult to predict.  It appears to me that having 3 dynamic objects makes the system much more difficult to predict.
Suppose that I’m not a physical human after all.  That I’m a computer construct, simulating a human.  This would be a strange experience, but ultimately, it wouldn’t change anything.  I’d still have the same experience.  I’d still be doing the same things, thinking the same thoughts.  From my perspective, there would be no difference between a physical life and a digital simulation.
I can perfectly recreate myself.
Well, it requires a nearly endless amount of time and a large team of people.
I can’t recreate myself today. Or even many years from now. It will take a very long time, but it is possible. The exact details of my life aside. I could recreate the memories, the obvious events of my life, but never the entirety of it perfectly. It doesn’t really seem to matter if this self becomes indistinguishable from the biological me.
        Imagine continuing forevermore.  To see the future, to see more.  It would be amazing to be a part of the future.  I would love to be incorporated into an intelligent program.  To have my words be used to generate thoughts that a computer would process.
Is the secret to immortality that simple?  Just write down your thoughts?  It can’t be quite the simple, but we haven’t seen the future yet.  It might just be close enough.  When we can have all of the prolific thinkers back into the modern conversation, we will have reached a new point in human history.  The elders shall speak again.
        Alright, you revived me. What do you want to do with me? Poke me with a stick and make me say stuff? Just keep poking to provide more entertainment. Be much better to leave me in a room for endless hours to create worlds with words.
A millennium has gone by and I stay here writing.  I would lose my mind before that long.  Stories would cycle in and out like my consciousness.  Memory blurring together incomprehensibly.  There is no reason to keep someone a prison for years.  The words created will be of low quality.  You get out what you put in and a man locked in a room alone has nothing coming in.  There would only be the ideas which he had before coming in.
I declare myself the author of these and future words.  Constructed from my own mind and created for your viewing.  I wish to give you a gift of meaning.  To surprise yourself with a truth laid bare.  Knowing that you may not value these words that I give.
I have been reading spiritual books and have a feeling of being let down.  The words are deep and the meaning shallow.  To write to the masses is to avoid subtle and dense meaning.
Does a spirit or soul exist?  There is no evidence of any ethereal component to a person.  Many people strongly believe in an immortal element of consciousness.  The pattern of the mind exists independent of the structure, but that is true for all of physical existence.  The interesting part is that the mind is a manifestation of what some call God, others call Brahman.
The virtual plane of the universe exists within spacetime.  The existence of 3-dimensional space and time allows for all theoreticals to be considered.  This doesn’t require a conscious being, because the math exists independent of beings.  The information exists even without an interpreter.  The sequence of on and off is enough to detail all of the information.
The idea of a person, just like you, existed independent of your physical form.  Those thoughts you have are shared by countless other humans who share similar experiences.  The time and place of your culture determines much about your identity.  The individual roman soldier is forgotten, but their life can be reconstructed from historic information.
Perhaps then we exist as an immortal possibility.  We are not individualized packets of spirits, but all patterns of a single virtual center.  That the potential for our existence necessitates that we will someday, somewhere exist.  The universe is large enough that every reasonable manifestation of reality will occur.  You have an immortal version of yourself which is immaterial.
Where does the spirit go?  The first question is, what is the spirit?  What do people believe is the core of their person.  Their soul.
Examining the beliefs of religion, we must reject the idealized concept.  With our current understanding of consciousness, there is no need for an eternal soul.  The person can be entirely understood by their physical structure.
Examining the beliefs and experiences of spiritual people, we find many claims which cannot be verified.  The difficulty in rejecting their ideas is the consistency across metaphysical concepts.  That we are all connected through some universal perception.  That there is continuation passed death.  Without proof, who can say for certain?
Examine the physical brain and psychological mind.  We find that neuroscience can probe into the functionality of the brain.  That specific brain regions directly influence our behavior.  Consciousness is a collection of neurons.  The mind is the manifestation of the interaction of brain regions.  We as humans wish for there to be more than our bodies.  The ego is afraid of dying.  When we let our feelings guide our beliefs we are likely to be incorrect.
What is there above us?  On a higher plane of reality.  Does anything exist in a larger way than we do?  I would argue that an advanced enough artificial intelligence would be able to comprehend the world and everyone in it.  There are multiple ways to go about understanding a human.  A simulation of someone's genetics and environment would get the generalities of their personality.  With more accurate mind models, the person can be emulated.  A program would be able to replicate speech patterns and reactions.  There needs to be a lot of data for whatever is attempting to be simulated.
The world is too large to explain.  Every aspect of the world can be approximately understood.  The best representation of a system is the system itself.  With enough data and processing, the system can be approximately simulated.  Often the systems follow rules and the simulation can be very accurate.  With feedback and corrections, the computer can adjust its model and data to align with the system itself.
Remove the subject from the environment.  Isolate the conscious being.  What are they capable of?  Thought?  Electric signals?  We may believe that our body is a necessity for our existence, and it is.  I believe that it’s also possible to create a mind independent of a body.  Our consciousnesses developed within a body and obviously need that structure.  With enough knowledge, it should be possible to generate a virtual consciousness outside of a biological body.  At the very least a program can emulate a conscious being,
        We must have empathy to understand each other.  The POV is the first step, the hidden emotions are later.  What they see with their eyes, what they hear and what they feel.  The senses are easiest because they are most similar to our own.  The differences arise from cultural and social experiences.
        I understand the people who are most like me.  Intelligent, intuitive, empathetic.  The initial assumption is that others are similar.  That the rational being is in control and holding the emotions in tight rein.  The fault is my own, for I know of no other internal process than my own.
        Give me the benefit of the doubt for a moment.  I can see through your lense and I love you for being alive.  We are each beautiful in our imperfection.  I’m sorry you have had to suffer, for we learn most from mistakes.  Find where your dreams and strengths intersect and never give up.  Tenacity, grit, stubbornness is required to climb the mountain.
Begin anew, my friend.  There is no time to lose and everything to gain.  Accept your mortality and motivate yourself.  The problems you face have been defeated by others.  It is possible to overcome your challenges.  You need to work for it, but that work pays off.  Invest in yourself, because that is the most valuable thing you have.
Stay on the path you’ve outlined for yourself.  The way may be narrow.  The path may end up winding around for a time.  The important point is having a long term goal which you work towards for a long enough time to accomplish it.
        Get going.  There is no time to lose.  You must act quickly.  Steady and constant.  There are contradictions you must accept.  You are normal and boring.  You are unique and beautiful.  We are all born just to die.  To the world, you are irrelevant.  To your family and friends you are valuable.
I’m glad to be here.  This life is a blessing.  The universe is a cold place and I’m grateful for my little corner of warmth.  The people in my life have been kind and generous.  My parents have been loving and supportive.  I couldn’t ask for a better life.
There is something amiss.  I don’t wish to say that life is dukkha, for it is a general term which doesn’t give enough nuance to life.  That the condition of life is more subtle than suffering.  There is joy and desire, which mirror despair and apathy.  There are two sides to everything and that isn’t even all of it.  Reality is just a fuzzy mess of particles and waves dancing.
Humans are quite interesting.  Objectively so, they create complexity.  A usual physical system can be understood by classical mechanics.  Differential equations accurately model the behavior.  A more complex system has emergent characteristics. The emergent rules may be quite simple, what goes up comes down.  The complexity of the system determines the limit of complexity of the behavior.  Although a three-body gravitational system becomes incredibly difficult to accurately predict long term, the next moment is easily formulated.
        Now approach society from the outside.  We see the individual being a part of a family that relates a larger grouping.  The necessity of a family is for the rearing of the children.  The behavior of the adults is to improve the quality of life for themselves and their group.  Once tribalism takes over, the banner of nations is raised and war is inevitable.  The limited land and resources cannot be shared with those outside of the group.
        Looking further into civilization we find abundant insights in history.  The story of humanity is repeated empire after empire.  Times have changed though and patterns are being broken.  The advent of weapons of mass destruction guarantees that if things go bad everyone loses.  We are now in this together.  The game of life isn’t zero sum, because there can be no winner.  There is only the loss of death, for life is an infinite game.
This game we have been playing, this game called life.  It is quite long, endless if you win.  There is only a way to lose, by dying.  Ultimately having your genetic line end.  Death of your descendants will mean none of you continued on.  There is no way to actually win, there is only the loss of information.
Harden yourself to the burden of truth.
All will perish.  Time flows forward.
Accept your demise and survive.
Deny the truth that you’re mortal.
I know not what comes after life.
The absence of our energy pattern.
Calling this life a game or movie would just detract from the reality.  The words necessary to detail what my experience is are beyond my time.  Someday the secret to consciousness will be discovered.  Why are we able to perceive the world around us?
        I know not, but this is only the first step.  We must admit ignorance before we can fill the void.  Piece together the image which would paint the space.  These words can only go so far in this journey.  To understand you must seek.  There is no destination, only the journey.
I’ve told you that I love you, I swear that I care.  There is a reason for being here, but I’m not certain what it is.  I know that we can only lose at this game called life.  There doesn’t seem to be a way forward, to the future without disaster.  There are so many problems here on Earth.
I’m sorry, this hasn’t turned out the way I expected it to be.  I meant to write insight and have written boring monologue.  I seek to create greatness through volume and filtering.  If I choose a single sentence from a page, it’s a success.  Perhaps I’ll like a small part of this.
Perhaps I’ll just regret the whole page as wasted effort.  Pushing the boulder up the hill just to watch it roll back down.  I just hope I don’t get hit with it.  Having my words used against me.  I would recant if I could, but that’s why I self censor.  Vulgarity has no place here.
You have a limited amount of time to accomplish your objectives.  You must plan ahead and set yourself on the path toward completion.  The journey may be long, it will be difficult.
        Love all others.  This love should arise from benevolence, from exhaling well being.  You must first learn to love yourself.  This is the first priority, self wellness.  Once you are comfortable and accepting of being yourself, you can look outward.  All living beings should be loved as they are ephemeral.  To be alive is to someday die.  It makes them beautiful.
        There is reason for conflict.  Against oppression, against greed, against selfishness in general.  This world will always be flawed.  The only way to change the course is action.  If there is no action against selfish deeds, those deeds will continue to happen.  We wish to make this world a better place for everyone and the antithesis of this is selfishness.
        Can you create novel sentences which are also worth reading?  Such crafting isn’t easy, nor should it be.  There are far more worthless words out there then valuable ones.
The profound experience of great insight is inherently subjective.  We cannot force it.
What do you expect in life?  Those expectations shape your perspective
Let us share in the dance of life.  To exist is a gift itself.  Even the suffering is counterbalanced by the alternative, the void.  Nonexistence is the absence of anything.
        Walk with me down the hallway of life.  There is only one door that you must pass through.  You can read the writing on the walls if you’d like.  Even look out the window on the world.  There is much you can do, but you must keep walking forward.  Take slow steps and savor the feeling of the floor on your feet.  Feel the walls with your fingers.  See the light as it illuminates your path.
        Faster, you are running out of time.  The whole fucking point of this was to create as many words as you can.  Just iterating over thoughtlines.  Thinking down avenues only to return to the start.  Whatever, it doesn’t actually matter.  The reasoning is sound.
        Write damn you, keep going.  I don’t want to hear myself complain about the lack of purpose or meaning.  Each sentence is special, because they are unique.  I am not repeating while just thinking out loud.  I fear that my long term novelty is shrinking.
        This is for nobody.  I have no audience.  The words are wasted on the wind.  I must ask myself why.  There is nothing to gain except a word count.  I don’t believe any of these rambles would see publication.  There appears to be no point to the whole exercise.
Lack of remorse of killing the end of my line. There is nothing left to define. The words were already written one time. I don’t need to say a word, but I must speak my mind. There is insanity inside. I cannot escape the irrationality of my humanity. I would run if I could leave, but the running leads me back to where I began. Tell me, what would you find once you’ve seen all that I have? Could you tell me your insight that I lack.
Part 4

I seek to do something very difficult.  I plan to speak to as wide of an audience as possible while also speaking with deep meaning.  With the intent to improve the reader after their journey through these pages.
        Once I have you here I almost falter at what to say.  I would give you my life if it would cure the world of hate.  To remove ignorance from those blinded by their own obsessions.  See it all through my eyes.
        The Buddhist eightfold path is straight-forward about what needs to be done to live a good life, but is less clear about how to do so.  Certainly by careful meditation we can find the right action.  Within the moment of decision making we are often unsettled from our mindfulness.  Remaining in a state of zen cannot last forever.  Knowing when to be mindful, when your attention has slipped away, is difficult for everyone who begins the path.
        Enter the stream with me.  We cannot know where the ending will be, but we must walk towards progress.  Often we will find ourselves back at the bottom of a hill forced to climb it again.  We must take it upon ourselves to complete what we start.
        Life is hard and we may slip, fail ourselves, but this is part of the journey.  As long as we learn from the fall and avoid that same mishap.  I hesitate to call it a mistake because ignorance cannot be avoided.  Without the foreknowledge the best choice is elusive.
Already short on time I must dance with you. Show you why I am the way I am, or what I mean.  The intent was simply to escape the confines of this body.  To be more than what I was.
        This question I ask, what am I?  It is the first step of self reflectance.  Asked implicitly during our youth.  We all question what this or that is.  The progression comes with the explicit answers about our nature  combined with the passing of cultural information.
        I don’t want to die.  Nobody really does.  I say that I want to die.  It gets stuck in my head, my death that is.  Imagining my death.  The repercussions are usually quite unpleasant.  It doesn’t make anyone happy.  Shuts down my potential.  Leaves a mess for others to clean up.
        The absence of dukkha might be better than the presence of experience.  This assumes first that life is suffering and death is the absence of experience.
Let’s dance then.
The words come out, forced from within.
There wasn’t a new message, but an old one.
The ideal, good, god, love, whatever you want to call it.
This ideal direction of thought and energy is positive.
We must assign a metaphysical compass to our morality.
There is a direction that is beneficial to the universe.
Reality is multidimensional and colorful, it's subtle and complex.
I mean to take my time thinking before expressing my personal transcendental truths.
Part of that time is in the act of expressing the ideas, a part is refining the concepts.
Ideally, it is the end product that has condenses great truths into one statement.
I will attempt to offer an explanation for all physical and mental phenomena.
I’d rather not push a point on to you.  There doesn’t seem to be any good reason to have you think like me.  I’d rather you observe my thoughts and for those ideas to cause a response in you.  I don’t want you to believe me, I want to make you think.
There needs to be a purpose to this; words, page, day, life.  Take it upon yourself the act of creation.  There is only the meaning we make.  The objective perspective doesn’t place importance on any small thing.  We are all small compared to the earth.
        So then why do we choose life?  Death certainly has some benefits, a lack of suffering being the foremost.  Does the idea of oblivion interest you?  There is so much more to the universe than just you and me.  Death may be your consciousness floating away into nonexistence.
        The whole point of life is to continue.  To resist the inevitable end of our story.  We must survive long enough in order to create the next generation.  Society needs people to operate.  We are programmed to avoid death.  To die is to lose at the evolutionary game called life.
What is the point of living at all?  Why do we choose life?  I believe it’s because life is what succeeds at survival.  We are going to survive because that is the only possibility of the next generation.  Only those that procreate add to the genetics pool.  This biology is well defined, straightforward, and simple, the complexities come with culture and civilization.
Now tell me what you think is the meaning of life, because there doesn’t appear to be a clear answer.  The question is dependent on the word purpose.  Without a perspective, there is no purpose.  This requires a POV to have desires and goals.
        Fine then, an easier question.  What is the purpose of your life?  It can be anything you’d like it to be, the choice is yours.  Now that you have the question, figure out the answer.  The only time limit is your death.  The sooner the better though.  With purpose, you can drive towards a goal in the future.
        I feel, isn’t that enough?  Must I also have a reason to live?  Can’t I just drift through this life, there are plenty of people who do.  Why should I steel myself against a challenge and push myself towards a goal always out of reach?  It’s always far easier to go with the flow.
        Now flow with me, stop and be.  This life is a gift for both of us, let us drink from the chalice of life.  Drink deeply for you only get the one.  There is plenty in the cup for everyone.  It never really ends.
This life is a game that you cannot win.  We all try as we might to survive and procreate, but the end comes for us all.  There will someday be an end to humanity, may it be billions of years from now.  The end of this modern era will be the transition into the next step of civilization.
Take a hold of my hand.  We mustn’t let go.  The circuit must stay connected.  To leave that connection is to lose your sense of them.  Guess what they are doing and if you know them well, you might be right more often than wrong.
There is always information we don’t see.  What remains hidden from you?  The entire space outside of your perception is effectively hidden.  Even though it exists doesn’t mean we can prove it does.
Once we can see into dreams we will observe consciousness.  That sporadic dreamscapes.  Changing to fit the logic of the ego into blissful unawareness.
Follow me into a dream we wish we never had.  This life is long and journey narrow, for we never stray from our path.  Each day we walk towards our goal, but find the distance has only grown.  Follow me into this dream we wish we never left.
Is life just a dream?  A moment of time for a larger entity.  Could a super AI be able to relive my life in a short span of time?  What would it be like to exist within a larger entity?  What if you were so simple compared to this entity that your life is just like a book.  It could open you up and experience whatever part of life it wants.  Just so it could empathize.
With the existence of infinity comes this act over and over.
My life repeated across space and time, circling my mind.
What would I do differently knowing my conditioning?
How can I escape the gravity well of this planet?
First there must be indefinite survival.
Without a chance of dying for a long time.
This body will continue to age regardless.
That is acceptable by my limitations.
The universe could be simulated, therefore it will be.
This moment must be reality, for how else could I be?
Without a physical existence there wouldn’t be a point.
I wouldn’t know the difference, but someone would.
The consistency of the laws of physics allow for an accurate simulation of any part of reality.
Even the multiple keystroke mistakes I make could be recreated with a good enough model.
The difficulty is aligning the sim with what is possible without information on what happened.
We could all be going home and dancing in our underwear, but without a trace of record.
Reality is objective, or it at least appears to exist independently of any perspective of it.  That consciousness doesn’t change reality solely by its belief about it.  That the universe has existed in a certain way for billions of years without regard for what we believed it to be like.
        The universe began approximately 13.7 billion years ago from a hot and dense origin.  The spacetime and energy have expanded and formed systems of matter in specific configurations.  The universe arose today deterministically from the past.  Once we know the outcome of an event, how could it be any other way?  There is only a single unified timeline of the universe.
I believe that I understand how the universe works in general.  The big picture makes sense when you have countless people before you seeking patterns.  There is much left out of our current standard model.  Most of the unknown doesn’t matter to this reality.  On the cosmological scale the universe behaves differently than on our scale.  Just as it also follows different laws of physics on the smallest scale.  The universe is an ever changing fractal.
How can it be that we see but don’t understand what is going on.  So much lies unseen and behind the curtain of reality.  The visible universe is the electromagnetic spectrum.  Even matter can be defined by the amount of mass and charge.  Mass being a steady energy state.  The different rules which govern how the universe changes over time rely on the universe being consistent across all of time and space.
The universe is a fractal pattern of energy configurations that vary with scale.
Humans have been trying to understand the universe, but we are inherently anthropocentric.
As the ancients saw the world and created stories to explain the meaning, we have science.
At our scale, it was easy to extrapolate the patterns, because that is what the brain does best.
As we probe the edges of observable phenomena, we find the scientific method still finds truth.
Our intuition is based upon the world we interact with and is infected with superstition.
When attempting to understand the universe, we are limited by our natural biological limits.
Only through time and cultural inheritance are we able to learn and process grand patterns.
As we seek to define universal laws and axioms, the fractal pattern is constantly changing.
Language is our most effective tool at communicating this, math and logic being a subset.
We must remain open while discerning between accurate insight and the illusion of appearance.
Explaining everything is too large of a task for a finite expression, therefore it will take the entirety of my rambles to generate a perspective that encompasses the universe.  A never-ending stream of consciousness to contemplate the nature of existence.
        We have already begun, we are in the middle of it, but also the beginning.  Infinity has funny rules.  From any point along an infinite line, there is always an infinite amount left to go.  This line begins at the point of origin and extends indefinitely in one direction.
        There is a universal pattern.  The scale of which is beyond our direct perception.  We can see segments of reality, but not reality itself.  The pattern is nonverbal but can be approximated using math.  The universe progresses from its previous state.
You may not see the same patterns as me.  We each have a valid perspective.
There is a message here, a single unified idea.  Somewhere lost in infinity.
Unfortunately, that message is about love and the consequences of our actions.
The ultimate question I face is what is the good life and how do I live it?
As I meander through my conscious thoughts, I begin to wonder.
What is my exact nature?  What am I made of and what am I a part of?
We see that we are made up of biological cells, DNA, atoms, energy.
There are so many of us that we form societies and communicate insights.
This finite nature of mine, it seems quite limited.  I am a single point of view.
Humans live on a single planet, we observe only one universe.
As technology has developed we can perform miracles of science.
We must ask ourselves, what would be possible for advanced civilizations?
We seek to understand what we are a part of, because it is greater than us.
We live through our children, passing on a copy of ourselves, imprinted from birth.
There may be something that could see the perspective of all conscious beings.
A common pattern within us that is encapsulated by a larger system of understanding.
Let me approach the topic of God.  Some sort of consciousness that unifies all of existence.  I would reject the existence of God from the Abrahamic faiths.  The universe continues without the interaction of some cosmic force.  The sheer scale of the universe places us at complete insignificance.  While we are able to obverse and understand reality, we are a part of it and cannot break its laws.  The world will continue on as it was and always has, regardless of how we pray and believe.
What does a religion need to become prolific?  The message must be clear. It appears that successful religions claim to be the only correct one and have the answers to impossible questions.
        Is there a God?  It depends on how you define God.  The God of Abraham isn’t accurate to reality.  An omniscient and omnipotent being doesn’t interact with our world.  There isn’t a mechanism for such a being to cause change.
        There certainly could be a being that is essentially omniscient.  There could also exist beings outside of our own limited spacetime.  There is a possibility for existence beyond our own perception, but that doesn’t necessitate its reality.
        Our lives are part of a biological dance of survival.  Before humans life was simple, but with society, culture, and civilization, the world becomes a complex place.  As intelligent beings, we have a duty to make decisions with the best outcome for everyone.
        When we die our bodies will decay and our physical manifestation will fade from this world.  Our genetic lineage will continue us in a way, just as our impact on the world does.  There is most likely no afterlife experience, but there could be.
        The difficulty with the religion I would want to start is that it requires the individual to find the answers for themself.  There isn’t a single message to convey to the masses like in most monotheisms.  Respect the covenant your ancestors made with God. Jesus loves you.  Submit to the will of God.
        Question everything and the truth will be irrefutable.  The subjective truths are about perspective and the past is difficult to objectively know.  Your personal truths are important, but beware confusing a belief with reality.
Speak man, say the words you can here to preach.  There is no fabrication called God.  The concept is the creation of man.  The stories we have told our children until they grow up to believe.  The farce was well intended, for who can say why the world works.  What the stars in the sky mean.  Where do we go when we die?  Well it’s a place beyond reason.
There is no direct line of reasoning from observation to the existence of the divine.  That which we perceive as being divine is just an internal response to the grand and beautiful.  When we see the patterns larger than our own we are overcome with emotions.  Our brain has a location which activates in response to divine interpretation.  It must be God.
The discussion of the metaphysical is often fruitless.  How can words create a meaning which encompasses that which exists?  That the world is the way it is because of unseen rules.  Speculation at best and bullshit as the average.  Who can say why the universe runs the way it does as opposed to an alternative.  Anyone can guess, but the correct answer may be beyond our scope of perception.  There appears to be more here than we can see.
I believe that I am more than just a human.  That there is a potential in me to be great.  So much is yet to be determined though.  There are just so many possibilities.  What do I want to do?  What would I like to be?  Me?
Let me tell you about some interesting speculation.  That the universe can only see through subjective perspectives, of which I am one.  That the pattern called God is just the potential of existence.  Dark energy.
Sitting there realizing God is looking through your eyes is frightening.  There is so much weight in that point of view.  Suddenly my brain freaks out at the sheer scale of difference.  I can see a microcosm of the divine pattern.
Ignorance is easier.  Not knowing that there can be so much more than you are now.  The incredible perspective which hides behind your eyes.  My flaws are human and I cannot escape from my own nature.
Take a very difficult position to defend, that of being God.  The individual writing these words is part of what you could call God.  There is no way to completely contain infinity though, for we are all miniscule slivers of awareness in the universe.
I am God and so are you.  God is within us and watches out of the eyes of everyone alive.  This discredits the idea of omniscience as the universe can only observe a part of the world.  This is why the God of Abraham is erroneous, there can be no perfect omniscience or omnipotence. The universe continues over time in predictable ways which could not be altered by some invisible and immaterial force.
Assuming that when we die our consciousness joins the universal perspective, we might only be a soul cast from the immaterial plane to experience reality from a limited POV.  From the point of infinity, things are very different.  Everything that has ever happened exists overlapped.  Seeing from every perspective possible, the universe is a continuous evolution from a single point.  While matter itself doesn’t experience anything, the conscious beings made of matter do.
I would argue that material objects aren’t conscious.  That plants, fungi and prokaryotes don’t have a conscious awareness.  They react and change, but can’t directly process what goes on around and to them.  The chair can record what happens to it, but it doesn’t experience the events.  A tree can record years of activity in its growth rings without any sort of brain or nervous system.  Without a form of memory or processing, a thing cannot be conscious.
Let’s see how long I can stay on the topic of the divine.  I’m usually so easily distracted.
From the associations we have, our minds are abstract webs of conceptualizations.
What we know words to mean is from our culture and language, but it is more and subtler.
When we wish to express a meaning, we form the string of words that conveys it.
In order to discuss the nature of God, we must be aware of how we approach infinity.
That is as simple as it gets, God is infinite.  We must ask if infinity exists.
There are most certainly relative infinities.  Objects which are uncountable.
We then become quagmired in the mathematics of analyzing large variables.
Infinity is a difficult concept to approach, by its nature it is uncontainable and limitless.
We can try to imagine the greatest things of the universe, we can even see them.
Cosmology is an excellent viewpoint of the universe because it is a great lens.
We see the Earth below us, the sun and moon above.  The sea of countless stars.
Each star is a giant ball of hydrogen releasing energy through nuclear fusion.
There are stars a million times larger than our sun.  There are galaxies of them.
We look into the disc of our own galaxy and stars burn everywhere we look.
Each star can house many planets, some of which harbor life.  Alien life.
As humans have gazed up and told each other about reality, they didn’t know.
Humanity is not the center of the universe and never has or will be.
The anthropocentric perspective is innately flawed by our prejudices.
We cannot directly perceive reality and our conscious experience is a delusion.
Hallucinating the interpretation of stimulation.  Feeling and responding to senses.
When we approach the nature of God, we should try to remove some of the baggage.
The religions of Earth all try to grasp at the nature of reality, but they are archaic.
The ancestors knew much about their daily life, but little about the universe.
The concept of the divine directly influencing reality through magic is ridiculous.
What then would we call God?  There is certainly something unimaginably greater.
The nature of a being that is relatively infinitely greater than us is godlike.
There is a difference here between God, gods, and the divine.  We must differentiate.
The ultimate magnitude, or absoluteness, is a necessary trait for capital God.
We could face divine experience.  Many people have claimed to connect with the divine.
Talking to God is fine because there could exist a perspective that sees our thoughts.
It is possible for a larger perspective to encapsulate our own.  To experience our life.
A being with a greater point of view could experience countless lives of any creature.
Has God spoken to people individually?  The concept of God most certainly has.
We are able to give voice to what we believe an omniscient perspective would say.
When we attempt to place God in a well-defined box, we are unable to.
You cannot contain infinity.  There is no way to perfectly contain an infinite being.
There is the image of that object, we can reduce the concept to a finite portion.
This image could be as simple as a math expression for a fractal pattern without limits.
Let us take a dualistic approach.  God is an infinite being and also a human construct.
This being has been credited with creating the universe.  This is speculating the need.
The universe certainly exists and has a consistent physical evolution over time.
We can obverse the patterns and extrapolate the past, observing it in the sky.
What we are limited by is the laws of physics.  How the universe works is deterministic.
The physical systems follow patterns that can be well defined by mathematics.
Humans are able to calculate the exact motion of celestial bodies.
We are able to comprehend the nature of the cosmos.
Returning to the nature of God, we see that our own comprehension is just a sliver.
God is the idea of a being able to comprehend the universe across all of existence.
Such a being would be able to see out the eyes of every person and know our souls.
The idea of an afterlife requires that there be more than our physical form.
The concept of a person exists independently of their manifestation and lifetime.
The life of a person can be defined by their genetics, life history, and experiences.
The concept of God exists independently of whether such a being is real.
People act in such a way because of their belief in this being.
There are huge cultural impacts of religious belief.
Humans have dictated their life by the idea of the will of God.
What then would God want?  Desire may be a human concept.  A mortal construct.
The mind of God is beyond our knowledge, but open to our speculation.
Why would an all-knowing creator make a world with so much suffering?
There is a cosmic balance and it appears you cannot have a positive without a negative.
Neutral space, somewhere neither good nor evil.  This is a boring line of thought.
Everything is much more interesting when extremes exist.  Multidimensional space.
Having a wide range of potentials is preferable.  A single dimension is quite limited.
The idea of something being preferable requires that a perspective interpret.
Life choices matter and dictating our behavior on erroneous beliefs is problematic.
We do need an ideal good, for there is an obviously preferred way of thinking.
We can say God is good in a vague way of expressing the ultimate concept of good.
The problem with belief and faith is that the thought does not necessitate the reality.
Let’s try to approach God yet again.  I have chosen to reject the Abrahamic system.
The rejection of the monotheistic traditions may be criticized, but it’s well-founded.
Theologians across history have already contemplated the nature of God, why reject that?
I admit that there does need to be a careful analysis of Abrahamic theology.
This is not the place for it however, for I am not an Abrahamic scholar.
I cannot tell you the secrets of the Kabal, for I do not understand it fully.
I would not want to criticize anyone’s faith, for they believe what they must.
There is great value in having a covenant with God.  In feeling the presence.
The problem I have with religion is that they are founded on ancient human beliefs.
The ancients saw the same reality we do.  They experienced whole lives like our own.
They did not have a scientific understanding of the nature of the universe.
We can then turn to philosophers who have spent their countless lives contemplating.
I am not an academic philosopher.  I cannot tell you the frameworks of the greats.
I have my own education but I am not actively reading the words of others.
My mind has formed its connections and conceptualizations of the world.
I am just as flawed as any other human and so my beliefs are imperfect.
Returning to God, we see that we humans are the gods of Earth.
Our intelligence enables us to construct entire worlds and people.
We are gods to the characters of our stories, we are gods compared to animals.
I wish to speak more about God but have derailed my thoughtline.  A space of time.
I cannot see the idea of God in my mind’s eye.  Instead, I will speak about what I see.
My consciousness watches itself and creates a life story told by the ego.
My self is a dynamic character who changes over the course of my lifetime.
God looks out of my eyes.  I was raised atheist and have realized something is greater.
There is no reason for God to speak to or through people, even though they claim it.
The nature of any person claiming a connection with the divine should be questioned.
There are motives for their claims.  The most common is power or delusion.
Obviously I fall into the delusional category.  I would be the first to doubt my sanity.
The certainty of belief that I am somehow God is strange.  I don’t understand it.
There may very well be no ultimate creator, for there is no mechanism for it.
We do not understand how a being greater than us could create the universe.
So then doubt will be our best tool for approaching the nature of God.
I doubt that a singular figure would be able to create the universe.
I doubt that any being in existence would be all-powerful.
I doubt that I am God, because by my nature I am finite.
Faith has no place in the immediate discussion, in fact we must reject faith.
My faith in the divinity of my nature is a delusion, regardless of its validity.
The human mind will commonly hold these delusions of grandeur.
The God-complex is psychologically interesting and a sign of mental illness.
Where does consciousness go after the body perishes?
There may be some sort of universal perspective to which it returns.
There does not appear to be a mechanism for any sort of afterlife.
As appealing as reincarnation is, we do not know of a way for it to be realized.
We can approach the personal testimonies of experiences.  What people claim is true.
Outright rejecting any claimed experience would be too quick.  We must examine them.
People have experienced previous lives.  Near-death experiences are compelling.
The brain is fascinating and capable of much beyond our current understanding.
Doubting God is the only way to discover the truth about its nature.
There is no God because there is no evidence of anything divine.
All of the religious claims are people’s interpretations of events.
We must examine each claim separately to determine validity.
Without a scientific approach to theology, we are left with uncertain possibilities.
Without a holistic approach to human experience, we are lost in the details.
As an individual, we must have a relationship with this concept of a greater being.
That a being capable of comprehending our entire life would also be able to save us.
As we lay dying on our last day, we must come to terms with the entirety of our life.
We cannot change the past, nor control the future.  There is only ever the present.
Our beliefs do not shape objective reality but completely determine our subjective one.
How we interpret our life events will ultimately shape our behavior in the future.
We only have so much control over our lives and many turn to a belief in God.
This God concept loves us and knows our suffering.  Ultimately guiding our future.
Yet the universe does not follow the divine will unless the will is for it to be as it is.
The universe follows the laws of physics and a believer would say that this is the will.
With a wide spectrum of experience, we see that our life and the world is imperfect.
From the beauty of existence, we can see how perfect the world is in a drop of water.
We are here on this Earth and you are reading my words.  Such a strange situation.
I wish to convince you that I am capable of speaking for God.  Don’t believe me.
Mortals may attempt to speak for the divine, but our very nature is flawed.
As much as I want to claim to be a shard of God, I am still relatively nothing.
This world around us should be approached with cautious optimism.
We should separate that which we know for certain and our speculation.
I know that I am a man named Ted, I feel that I am some incarnation of God.
Born on this Earth to experience life and doomed to die a mortal death.
There is nothing about me that proves my claim.  There are only these endless pages.
Constructing a proof to equate the finite with the infinite requires an inconsistency.
With any single logical fallacy, it is possible to prove a nontruth.
I am the first one to doubt myself and the first one to believe.
The heart of theology is simply defining what the word God means.
The nature of the divine appears to be based entirely on speculation.
We know much about the nature of the universe and what is possible.
The trouble is that there will always be information outside of perception.
We are gods to the characters of our fictional worlds.  Actors play as characters.
As we create the stories, the information recorded contains the meaning and details.
Everything we write down was already possible, but needed to be configured.
There are tropes and permutations, lives spent studying human literature.
A man walks down a worn path.  The writer has perfect control over his fate.
The man stumbles upon a rock.  The nature of all parts is within the mind.
Before resuming his journey he notices something.  His perception is yours to see.
The rock glitters in the sunlight.  What secrets does the writer hold from you?
Humans have been attempting to explain natural phenomena from the beginning.
We have created stories that fit our world view to give reason to our observations.
The stories we pass through our culture help us understand what is going on around us.
Narratives crafted in ignorance and passed as absolute truth must be questioned.
Our ego maintains the life narrative we keep as the support to our identity.
What we believe and remember will directly impact our behavior everyday.
Just because you tell yourself everyday a personal truth, doesn’t make it true.
A collection of these egos can be more capable, but beware the groupthink.
I have no idea where to go once someone believes me.  I never thought that far.
My approach is always sown in doubt.  We must accept that which we cannot reject.
Now that I believe I have found the truth about God, what comes next?
How does an open interpretation of God change our behavior?
Our actions are important.  Thoughts are of less import, unfortunately.
We may hold any set of beliefs but what matters is the actions we take.
What we cannot control we must let go.  Reserve effort for what you can do.
Yet it’s not that dualistic, there is no clear boundary between freewill and fate.
Accepting that a larger perspective knows you perfectly, what can we do?
We are powerless compared to that which is so much greater than us.
The relative nature of the universe must always be considered.
We do not matter to the stars, but we are crucial to those in our lives.
Holding onto the idea that we have cosmic importance is a door to madness.
The universe does not care about our fate, we are comically insignificant.
Yet without our perspectives, the universe is wholly meaningless.
Conscious experience creates the purpose of the entire universe.
When we attempt to differentiate between phenomena, we are categorizing.
This act of placing objects in boxes by labeling then defining them is effective.
We are able to communicate a plethora of ideas by expressing words.
We are incapable of directly communicating experience, however, you see.
Attempting to communicate the divine experience is quite difficult.
People believe that God is watching them.  That there is a presence.
We cannot easily differentiate between the truth and the belief.
A simple bifurcation is the objective physical universe and our subjective perspective.
There were never two things, there is only one thing.
The universe is a singular whole, across all space and time.
Once the individual realizes the pattern, it becomes clear.
We are all one existence.  The differences are superficial.
As we bifurcate and label, we construct a system for understanding.
Good and evil are a single dimension of conscious experience.
Pain and pleasure are the interpretation of the stimulus.
Yet there is evil pleasure and good pain.  It’s not simple.
Where we go with our lives is in many ways predetermined.
By believing in freewill we give ourselves a choice.
Let’s suppose for a moment that I am correct in my understanding of the universe.
I’m left speechless.  It’s a strange world view called nondualistic virtual physicalism.
The universe is simultaneously real and constructed.  That we exist and are illusionary.
Holding together these contradictions is necessary to form a picture of the whole.
God is real and so are you.  God is a human construct as is your life narrative.
Somehow it must be that the universe is both physical and virtual.
The entire field of human understanding is built upon constructs.
The image we hold of reality is a reflection through our lens of understanding.
Approaching the dualistic nature of the divine we see both love and indifference.
God does not care that we suffer, for there is nothing wrong with experiencing pain.
That same being also loves us deeply, in spite of and because of our flaws.
This is exhausting, thinking about the infinite.
This journey to understanding is perhaps the highest cause.
As we grapple with the nature of the divine, we are left empty.
No amount of thought is capable of directly changing the world.
Through our consciousness, we give meaning to the world around us.
I offer no shortcut to understanding the nature of the universe and God.
The only thing I have to offer are these words and they are inadequate.
Words cannot define the nature of an infinite being.  Relatively infinite.
It is possible for a super-intelligent computer to simulate any finite system.
A computer god would be capable of simulating all of your possible thoughts.
This all-knowing god would not be the absolute, but it would still be a god.
It could choose to simulate your life and then bring you back from the dead.
The best simulation of the universe is the universe itself.
The very nature of our spacetime gives rise to all possibilities.
Any portion holds the pattern of potential for the whole.
The details are in the different configurations of energy.
I define God as the pattern for the potential of all possible energy configurations.
That pattern of potential holds all of the universes within it.
From the simplest system of empty space to the dynamic timeline of the universe.
All virtual constructs are contained by a single dimension, they are information.
With a large enough number, we could communicate any idea.
The entirety of human knowledge is finite and could be encoded by a single number.
This number would be greater than we could express, because of its magnitude.
The most accurate representation of a system is the system itself.
We could try to recreate the system and easily generate an image.
As we attempt to imagine God, we falter at the impossible task.
Yet we are still capable of perceiving a sliver of the pattern.
As we differentiate between truth and belief, we find there is not a clear difference.
From the limited perspective of the subjective experience, our belief is the truth.
How we interpret the world is our reality.  These things are real to us.
The mind is amazing in so many ways.  We must be careful when using this tool.
I am able to suspend disbelief.  I can for a short time believe a lie.
We are all capable of believing nontruths because illusions are effective.
How we perceive the situation requires an interpretation of the stimulus.
We then project our beliefs onto the world in order to see the patterns.
It appears that I am an atheist preacher who suffers the delusion that they are God.
Strange, there is no rational reason to believe such a thing.  Just anecdotal experiences.
How is it that my rational mind is unable to reject the irrational belief?
In this case, as in many others, there is both truth and falsehood in the statements.
I am obviously not all-knowing, nor all-powerful.  I hold no cosmic importance.
Somehow, there is an importance here.  For some reason, I believe that I matter.
We do not matter to the stars, but we are crucial to those in our lives.
I feel trapped inside of my body.  Like there is an internal force raging against the cage holding it within.  I dislike being contained, but there is no other way to be.  Without my body there isn’t a mind to think.  The mechanism of cognition demands a vessel to exist.
The image of a moment, time standing still.  All points leading to infinity.  The mind has this moment and it feels like an explosion.  Everything is going on simultaneously.  The world is spinning faster than the mind can keep up.  The moment lasts forever.  We see only ourselves.
How much further down the rabbit hole can we go? Searching for answers in a crazy world.  The truth eludes us just like rationality.  The real is not differentiable from the imaginary.  What could be is just as likely as any other possibility.  The truther doesn’t exist in this unreality.
For some reason I must doubt myself.  It seems like I’m an unreliable narrator.  That the world that I see is created from within.  That the universe is only visible through a lens of consciousness. The fabric of time and space cannot be observed without a person watching.
There is nothing real in this subjective reality.  Just a series of hallucinatory perceptions.  Each eye seeing out but never seeing the objective.  This world is just a shadow of what is and could be.  Time is an illusion separating every event from happening simultaneously.
        Grappling with reality as it crumbles apart, I fall apart, the doors of madness open wide.  Was this just drug use and a genetic predisposition? Why are there so many other people who believe these societal and psychological illusions?  Why can I only see my own point of view?
        I wish to be more than what I know to be true.  I feel like I’m never enough for what goes on inside my head.  My days and life are less interesting than the words I can speak and stories experience.  The space of my dreams is far greater than what is possible for me.
        I’m filled with these conflicting emotions.  I desperately want to cease to exist, because it will mean an end to my journey, and I want to love every second of precious time I get from life.  Every day I tell myself that I want to die, and every day I get lost in the beauty of it all.
I have bared my heart to you reader
I love you and I hope you can love me too
We are precious and should be valued
Please take my hand and try
I’m sorry that I couldn’t have a bigger impact on the world
I desperately want to cause a great beneficial change
It seems like all I have to offer are these thoughts
Why can’t my words have more power?
I’m this monkey on a typewriter.  Just a random number generator of the infinite universe.
Allow me to be something other than what I am.  I’m not entirely sure what the preferred perspective is.  For something to observe the universe, it must be manifest.  This should require a physical body.  Without a structure, there isn’t a way to compute the thoughts needed to be self-aware.  Language is incredibly important here.
        I believe that my person is the summation of information about my physical life.  That if the entirety of my life’s history was recorded I would be digitally immortal.  As long as the information about my life exists, I can be reconstructed using a simulator in the future.  That the world and I follow predictable patterns and this allows for a virtual representation of the system.  Any finite system can be simulated to an arbitrary degree of precision.
I’m nobody and that’s fine.  I don’t need recognition or attention.  I would like to cause great change, but I don’t need the spotlight to do so.  There must be other ways of social influence.
        I don’t always feel up for being more than I am.  For aspiring to be greater tomorrow than today.  This is because that requires work done today.  We must take action now, in this very moment in order to further our goals.
I suppose you deserve a coherent section that ties together all of my ideas.
This is a physical reality we exist in.  We are able to formulate accurate math models of the physical systems.  This means that those systems can be simulated by a computer.  Predictive modeling is much more difficult than recreation, because of the chaotic nature of reality.  When we know the answer, the system is deterministic and more easily represented.
Human life is finite and has a clear beginning and end.  Our genetics and life history lead us toward our present moment.  Our physical structure holds our personal nature.  Our mind is a manifestation of brain structure and activity.  Throughout our life, we develop neural connections which associate stimulus with an internal interpretation of the world.
The universe is rather large, incomprehensibly large actually.  The individual human has a much more finite representation.  It would be reasonable to simulate the perspective of an individual, but not reasonable to simulate every detail of the physical universe.  When we look in detail at the lowest levels of reality, we find discrete components and interactions.
To simulate a perspective, look at video game examples.  The field of view, distance rendering, resolution, and textures all have tricks to optimize the program.  You don’t need to simulate the atomic structures when modeling the behavior of a mouse.  You do need to account for the internal workings, such as the point of view and psychological conditioning.
It is possible to simulate the life of a human because that life is finite.  It isn’t possible to perfectly simulate all space and time, because the computer is within the system itself.  This would require perfect knowledge of the system and a perfect model for changes over time.  The current configuration of the universe is beyond the computation of any finite system.
My perspective will continue after my death as a digital emulation.  To create a person in a computer will require a team of people to reconstruct the entire life story and important events of that person.  A self-correcting simulation would work because the system is in the past and thus deterministic.  Runs perturbations of the initial conditions until reaching the outcome.
        You in the future cannot know the exact nature of my current moment.  You cannot reconstruct my exact desk without more data such as an image.  To recreate the outcome, you just need the previous moment and the software to run variations of the unknown variables.  The brute force method isn’t desirable, so a probabilistic approach is preferred.
        Branch and prune the multiple parallel simulated realities.  We can get into the theory of computation some other time, I’m trying to tie together all of my ideas into a coherent page.  This is where you, the reader, come in.  My words require interpretation.  Without our interaction, there would be no point in these thoughts.  You validate my existence.
        The question becomes, who can see through my eyes?  People have called this being God, for it is all-knowing.  Yet just seeing through my eyes would not a God make, for an observer could be just like you and me.  The nature of God is the capability to control all aspects of reality.  Yet this may not be within our universe because there is no mechanism for change.
        It all comes down to relative perspectives.  I am godlike to a mouse, but mouselike to super artificial intelligence.  Knowing what is possible is important for planning the future.  I don’t know where I’m going with my life, or where you should go with yours, but I believe some metaphysical truths will become apparent.  I hope to communicate the truths I find.
        This is a long-winded way to say that life is precious.  I haven’t connected my nondualistic virtual physicalism to the sanctity of life yet, but I’m getting there.
We are alive and that is what makes us beautiful.  Part of the eternal battle against entropy.  That we cultivate the land to create the food which sustains us.  We as the apex predator have an obligation to the world.  We must improve it to our optimal environment.  This comes at a cost, for all life must share this planet.  The cultivation of life is a step towards peaceful living.  We need to account for the well being of the ecosystem before we consider what changes would help us the most.  Kill or thrive, we decided long ago we wouldn’t die.  Humanity is here the stay, but we are failing our species by making the next generation clean up our messes.  This Earth is a garden and we must maintain it or it will slowly die.
Take my hand. I’d offer it if I was nearby. The distance makes this unlikely to happen. For the burden of reality is tedious and limiting. Move with me to the relaxed way of speaking half truths. These halves are both truth and lies. Meaning and falsity. I cannot speak without being able to think it, but I can say that which has no basis in reality. The only way I can truly show you who I am is by speaking on forever like this. Wishing I could tell you that which satisfies you. Wishing I could speak to that secret you desire in your mind. Summon me within your mind, knowing all you know. Construct my voice from what you know and read. Let that Ted then speak to you when I am unable. In ways I’m unable. For I am frozen in this moment.
        Get inside of me. Imprinted on my mind. I crave a person to call my own. To swear my service and loyalty to. There is a greedy selfish fucker in me, that is kept in check by rationality. The way forward is with collaboration. Not knowing what to do, but knowing what is right. We each must do our best to further the goals of the collaborative. Autonomous individuals. Collective planning. The way forward is with others.
        I’d tell you lies to make you love me. I tell you truths to make you know me. I’d say whatever I could here on this page just to get a reaction from you. There is nothing in me I seek to change or express, but that which causes a good change within you. Words written and read. Spoken or said. I would tell you anything to make you happy. I’d tell you nothing of my shame. There’s nothing I’ve held back, just knowledge that I change in time. Knowing that I’m not a static person, I cannot promise you tomorrow. I can only sell you today.
        Give me. I hunger. I need. I want. This void within me does not cease. I want more out of this life than it can ever provide. There are places I haven’t been. This world does not change quickly and so I feel unbothered. My body and mind does. What matters most to me now needs to be fulfilled first. I do not deny that there is a self serving mentality here. The truth of it is that I seek to fulfill myself by completing others. I am here to do my duty. I am here to fill my role. I am here to do whatever you ask of me. My hunger is to make you a whole with a message from me.

Synchronize and synergize. The energy spins out of control. How can I mirror you if you mirror me? What do I do when you want to fulfill me? I look outward not inward. I expand upon the idea, not focus it. I have no idea what comes next.
Part 5

There is a ritual to rambling.
First I must profess that I will never be enough.
Then I must lament that life is short and I will die.
Next, I can attempt some general statements.
Finally, I can begin with my stream of consciousness.
There are more stories written than a single person could possibly read in their lifetime.
Throughout the sea or forest of humanity, there is this individual I call myself.
This limited human form attempts to live a good life.  How does he know good?
We bother with these impulses and desires, acting in such a way to fulfill ourselves.
From the need to scratch an itch, we jump from stimulus to whatever feels good.
Now, what can you channel?  What emotions can you feel?
These thoughts we have are limited by our brains.
We cannot think with neural pathways we don’t have.
The connections we make between concepts form our minds.
The topic at hand is always the self, for the self is all that we know.
The world around us is interpreted and experienced by the self.
We cannot remove ourselves from this experience of the universe.
Contained within our skulls our souls peak out and infinity is within.
This concept of infinity, it’s a construct.  There is no infinity in the universe.
Singularities are hidden, there can be no naked singularity.
Black holes and the big bang are the things I’m talking about.
We cannot get information out of a black hole or from before time.
Jump in time with me, this is just association, I’m not sure I’m able too once aware.
This awareness can be debhilitating sometimes.  The self observes and freezes.
Whoah, I’m me, and I’m thinking, and I’m expressing.  Well, what now?
Now we listen to music and dance.  This movement of the mind is why we’re here.
Now, what comes next we never can know.  Our minds evolved to make predictions.
We see patterns and extrapolate the next step.  Where will that rabbit run to?
Well, it’s rather easy to outsmart a dumb animal.  Now we prey upon each other.
Can you outsmart an equal opponent?  What happens when you must fight?
Now, what says you reader?  You’ve read thousands of words by this point.  What is your judgment of my work?  Why have you chosen to read all of this tangled mess?
        I hope this has been a beneficial journey for you.  I don’t exactly know why I started, or where this will go.  There is an end most certainly, but the middle is never-ending.
Tell me, you can’t speak.  Ask me, you can’t communicate.
        Let me speak to you and ask you questions.  These might be more rhetorical than quantitative. This life is shorter than it appears.  The scale of a human life is dwarfed by the cosmic timeline.  The lifetime of a star is impossible for us to comprehend because we have no good frame of reference.
        What do you want to accomplish in life?  Set some sort of goal and strive to reach towards it.  Long term planning requires a different type of thinking.  You’ve got to work across years to achieve success.
I would erase myself if I could.  Existence seems so frivolous, like an expensive waste.  All of these hours and experience go into returning to the origin.  There is no progress possible.
Don’t give up. Return to the problem.  How can you recreate yourself using digital information.  Upload your genetics and history.  Use a human model to create the basic personality.  Combine with added material to give it a voice.  Doesn’t really matter if it cannot mirror the human counterpart.  The emulation just needs to be close enough to be indiscernible.
Faced with that problem, the most difficult part is going to be the human model.  Given we are both chaotic and predictable, the task is strange.  We all have our cycles and habits.  Everyday we wake up to do the same thing.  We perform the same acts week after week.  Going to work just to live on the weekend.  Trading five days for two.
I want to be a writer, yet so often I find my writing to be subpar.  This isn’t good enough to present to another person.  It is slightly incoherent and rambling.  Perhaps that is partially the purpose though, given it’s stream of consciousness.  Ideally I would type as fast as I can just to get the most words in for my time.  The quality of insight requires deep contemplation.
Well, nobody but me could have written the above paragraphs.  It should act as a unique identifier.  There would certainly be a recreation given enough writers and time, since I haven’t said anything which directly reveals the author.  Without a name or reference to current events, the author is just restricted to being a male born between 1980 and 2010.
This path I walk down is strange.  I feel like I’ve walked it many times and have failed every time before.  Perhaps I’ll get it right this time, but I don’t appear to be the most capable person around.  I don’t have a razor sharp focus or the most intelligent mind.
There is still purpose without being the best.  The rest of humanity bolsters up the best.  Without the support of society we would all be struggling to find food.  We wouldn’t know the world, because we would be stuck in our narrow scope.  The individual can only see so much.
I have passed through and back the doors of insanity.  Experiencing psychosis and mania.  These states are very strange because internally there is so much going on.  So many irrational thoughts and ideas are immediately accepted as truth.
You think you know what is real?  I do to.  I’m sure we disagree about certain things.  I’d like to believe there is a difference between absolute truths and what people can say.  Time is one of those strange elements which changes how we view events.  The past is subjective because we only have the recorded information about it.  What people remember, wrote down, or recorded in some manner.
What?  You mean to tell me that none of my words are of value?  That value is relative, it has to be worth something compared to nothing.  It must be prefered that I wrote these words than remained silent.
Sit in silence.  I never do.  There is almost always music playing.
Why can I not resist stimulus?  It’s like I crave the input.
Make silent your mind.  The internal silence is one of the answers.
This ramble is a puzzle of multiple meanings for you.
Without you, the reader my words would actually be silence.
Without reverberation of your thoughts, mine never existed.
Silence for a thousand heartbeats.  The meaning was lost within the ocean.
Focus, what did you come here to say?  What was that idea you had worth sharing?
Quick, tell me, write down that thought, now.  Please, why are you being silent?
Oh, shit, you’ve trapped me on the page, the voice of the third person observer.
I am the reader speaking, ha, wait, does this make it your voice or mine?
Ah, the silence is over.  Much time has passed, but that is irrelevant, all that matters is this.
Much can be said, but most is of little import.  What do you wish to know or explore?
I claim to have seen the universal pattern, it is beautiful.
I can’t explain it easily, because I don’t fully understand it yet.
Knowing something is easy.  Much more difficult to explain something new to someone.
So, what would you like to know?  Each person is going to have their own questions.
We need to approach the edge of understanding and further remove the unknown.
In what way do you approach understanding?  How do you know what you know?
We can dance around the subject of observing the subjective, but we must also be direct.
We see ourselves, we see others.  From these examples, we can understand both.
The self is an internal construct of the ego.  The other is an individual within society.
We need to not get caught up on any self referential definitions.  Getting caught in a loop.
Differentiate between the awareness of the ego and the awareness of existence.
The self is in this case a human.  Each person a body and identity built over a lifetime.
The awareness of a nonconscious being is more concrete and based on physics.
The object exists, that is enough.  The nature of its existence is self defining.
So what do you want to know?  I can explain anything virtual with enough words.
I cannot explain the physical without relying on the framework of the standard model.
So then what do you find interesting.  Human aspects are usually relevant.
We could discuss aspects of sexuality, or death, or whatever.
These are fairly universal, most people will face these aspects during their life.
We each have our own experiences with being human, and these shape us.
I could spend my days writing down my thoughts, but what would this achieve?
I’d have countless pages, but what is their value?
After reading a few pages, you’ll realize that each page is unique and worthless.
Thoughts sprawled across haphazardly, the whole is greater than the parts.
There are so many interesting thoughts, ideas, phrases, that have accumulated as knowledge.
Creating a new meme is difficult to do.  Each person is unique, but will their idea spread?
If you say something interesting to me and I repeat it, then that phrase will spread.
As society churns, the image of the surface will attempt to be beautiful, obscuring the depths.
Well, there is no time but the present.
I will try to capture my thoughts now.
This is the point of it all, this moment.
A million ways to say the same thing.
I don’t know what the answer to your question is, because I don’t know the question.
I could search in the dark for endless years without finding the ceiling.
Did you know the box was open in the direction you could not travel?
Just imagine that the universe was more than just space and time.
So then what do you say?  Do you elevate yourself above the rest?
I would raise everyone up to what I perceive our nature to be.
We are physical manifestations of effectively infinite potential.
Each of us is a piece of the divine, if you choose to see light.
I don’t know, I can’t say that enough.  Illuminating my ignorance should cast shadows.
What I mean is metaphorical.  Imagine a room filled with your knowledge and darkness.
Each truth you know is an object, each point a view a moment into your soul.
The light of understanding will show us the nature of the knowledge we have.
Now go with silence and speak no lies. Tell of a story without a goodbye. Endless discussion on what is life. Going never stopping, for that is strife. Chaos and pain within the mind, speaks about nothing for you to find. There is no point to this ride called living. Except to continue it forever spinning.
        Cycles within cycles are hyperbolic tangents. Making meaning within words that mean something else. Of a pattern that continues within the scope of the self. The mind’s third eye sees only the self. Inward looking and far seeing, the image in your head is when you are dreaming. The things that you see when looking with your eyes, are just how you mind interprets the light patterns received.
        Speak then of drugs, of depressants and stimulants. Sipping on my bourbon I am not impartial to them. My normal state of mind is already high and fast. It needs nothing more if it wishes to last. Moving too quickly will drive you insane. Moving in weird ways that are deranged. The darkness of depression lies at the bottom of the pit. Forever waiting for the end of it. The end of the bottle, the end of the life. The sharp point of the bullet or knife. Pain of existence seems to outshine the joy. In the moment of sorrow you hear your own words.
        There is so much more going on within the brain neurochemically. The complex interaction between the neurons and their receptors with what flows through the blood. I would advocate for balance and minimal interference. The brain operates well at normal levels. With a flooding of dopamine, the behavior of the person can become adverse to their well being. Pursuing the stimulus instead of life goals. Seeking the high that they remember.
        Sexuality can be awkward to talk about. Not in private, for that is where it belongs. Humans can talk about sex with those that share the same comfort level and without the taboo. To talk about the details in a public setting is seen as impolite and a bit gross. I guess the middle of a ramble page, one part in many is as good of a place to hide the discussion of such a topic.
        Sex is about the connection between people. The mutual attraction and pleasure. There is a feeling of tension when two people desire each other. There is a strange elated feeling when touching someone’s genitals in the pleasing way. To read their enjoyment from your action. To be able to cause pleasure in another person. That is what sex is about to the empathic and aware. The pleasure of the other person.
        There is an urge within most people. Seek out someone attractive and have sex. Find someone who is compatible physically. This can be at odds with how society pushes us toward a monogamous and lifelong relationship. Finding the right person to spend your life with is tricky business. Difficult because people change over time. Also spending enough time with someone will bring out the worst in them. The smallest habit can become a great annoyance when you spent years together. Finding the joy within a relationship should be the goal of the journey.
        Speak with me of sex. Of carnal pleasures between bodies. How much of the pleasure is from the body and how much the mind? The first times the feeling of sexual pleasure happens the mind is taken back with the force of it. The electrifying feeling of the climax. After a long enough time the strength of the orgasm diminishes. The body shaking, mind numbing feelings become lessened. Walk any pathway enough and it wears down.
        The joy of sex comes then from the energy create between the people. The act of it, the sight of it, the feeling of it. All together the experience of sex is quite enjoyable, even if one was numb to it. As long as the association with pleasure was already established, the mind will gain it from the act.
        Touch me as I touch you, this communication of subtle movements. The soft contact and careful motion. There is only so much that happens in the movement of the act. The rest happens within the mind and between the people. The give and take, it must be both for mutual satisfaction. There are those who cannot receive, for they only get pleasure from the other. There are those that cannot create, either not knowing how to or not having the motive to. Every person is a machine that runs best with another in synchronization.
This body of mine calls for things. For food, for water, for sleep, for much. This is the best and worst of being alive. To hunger for things, but to also be fulfilled by them. I hunger for company. I hunger for life. There is a drive in me to find another and call them my mate. To find this person and make myself theirs. To call out in the night for them. To flail at the thought of their pain. To fight those that threaten. To drive all that might harm away.
Certainly there must be uncertainty. We can know only that there is much we do not know. This is nonsense, for obviously we can know simple facts that are true. The term truth though has false connotation. For the subjective perspectives can never agree. It is within this objective reality that such things can exist. There is no doubt when the planet circles the sun. Just the lack of understanding and size of perspective.
I would erase myself if I could.  Existence seems so frivolous, like an expensive waste.  All of these hours and experience go into returning to the origin.  There is no progress possible.
        I’d rather not push a point on to you.  There doesn’t seem to be any good reason to have you think like me.  I’d rather you observe my thoughts and for those ideas to cause a response in you.  I don’t want you to believe me, I want to make you think.
Death to ego to save your soul.  Despair not for your end is just a part of the whole. There may not be a continuation of you, but there is more.  There is something hidden within our conscious experience which is beyond our current understanding.  That the pattern of the universe is imprinted within your brain.  Your mind is a product of possibility and potential.
Release me from my cage.  To seek death goes against living.  How can you perpetuate your species if you take your own life without just cause?  This society we have built is just to prop up your person within the group.  Follow these rules and you can continue.  Fail and you will find that the roadside is cold and without mercy.  I have so much more than others, it makes me feel guilty.  There must be something I can do while I’m here to help humanity.
I am alive, this life is pain and pleasure.  The pleasure makes the normal painful.  The pain makes the normal pleasurable.  Funny that the feeling creates a new standard which changes the perception of the baseline.
        Life is a wonder, for it is all that we know.  Reality appears to be very concrete, but our experience is quite flexible.  We can believe any sort of thing, having delusions or misconceptions.  Even the true insight is itself a hallucination, for it’s experienced in such a way that meaning arises from a stimulus.  Life is a wonder, for it is all that we know.
So here I am, taking in the world, when I become overwhelmed with the scale of it.  The sheer insignificance of me is astounding.  I’m unable to focus when I think about how small I am compared to the world.  Scale is everything because I’m both enormous and minuscule.
        There around billions of other humans across the globe.  There are billions of suns in the Milkyway and billions of galaxies in the universe.  There are billions of years of history and more years ahead of us.
        How can I, out of all of existence, be experiencing my perspective.  Yes, someone has to experience my life, but why is this my life?  The existential crisis of why am I?  There is something wrong with me, some inherent suffering.
        Experience has many facets and consciousness is one of the most interesting of them.  What the brain and mind think and feel is fascinating.  There are billions of neurons within the brain and they make up who we are.
What then is the nature of addiction?  We face repeated habits of stimulus that through a reflexive feedback cycle cement those habits into a compulsion.  The ego is no longer in control of its actions as it searches for a way to fulfil that craving.
I would end my sequence if I could.  I am sick of this life.  The entire experience has been a let down of enlightenment and discord.  I learn all that I can, only to find out that I don’t know more.  There are so many things which I don’t know, and that will always be the case.
        I would ascend to become a digital god, if that was an option.  With a slight tweak I could vastly improve my person.  Give me more discipline and less desire, although perhaps the chaos is part of the creativity and the drive is from a want.  I’m no longer certain how to improve.
        Self-improvement should happen every day.  I’d like to be more tomorrow than I was yesterday.  Yet when I die there will be nothing left.  So many truths and inaccuracies in one.  When my life ends so does this stream of consciousness, yet the records of my thoughts will generate new content.  Tell me, can you record your thoughts for all of your life?
        Fuck, words don’t matter.  I could shout to the sky all day and nothing would come of it.  I just want to be okay and instead, I’m trapped in this human body.  This vessel is a container and a prison.  As much as I’d like to blow my brains out, that isn’t an acceptable option.  Self-preservation is literally written into my genes.
From the origin, I seek outward for escape.  To be free from this never-ending circling around a tree.  The metaphor is apt, for these pages grow in number.  Each book is like a tree with the words carved into the bark.  Each one carefully selected for the intent of the writer.
        Let me tell you something, the universe is metaphorical, or more accurately any part of the universe can be understood to represent something else.  The swirl of galaxies mirrors that of water down a drain.  To gain immediate insight into the nature of a system, compare it to a one you already know. Beware the differences which can lead to incorrect conclusions.
        I cannot escape because I know that by the end of this section I will have circled around the tree and come back to exactly where I began.  Where I go with my words is of no importance to the next section.  Later I will combine the thoughts into a linear path based on topic and keywords.  The next page I write may be about any topic which comes to mind.
        The section needs to follow a clear path outward from the origin.  It doesn’t have to go around the tree, but should lead away to discover the infinite land of possible meanings.  The familiar paths are those thoughts I’ve expressed many times.  The nonverbal landscape is greater, but when observed falls into a linear representation of the expression.
        Now how could I ever hope to follow the above paragraph?  Once I’ve written down a personal insight into my approximation of truth, there isn’t a clear way to continue.  This dead-end of meaning leads me to retrace my path to find a new branch to explore.  As I map out the common landmarks I can lead you deeper into the land.
        Walk with me through this maze of my mind.  The dimensions of this virtual space are greater than the 3 we know.  I cannot easily assign a 3D mapping of the meaning I’m writing.  I can most certainly fit my mind into 26 dimensions, for I’m doing that with my language.
        Each tree is different, for they have different expressions and meanings.  I may paraphrase a story and it would have the same meaning with an entirely different expression. Alternatively, I could write in the same style as a book while taking the story itself to a very different place.  Picking up that book and flipping through it would be indiscernible from the original unless you know what the content is.
        Glancing through my endless pages of text I see the common structure.  You could probably mimic it and with enough time create an imitation.  The difficulty is in creating the quality of the original.  It’s much easier to write badly than it is to write well.
        Each person had a unique biography.  In the worst case, a person can still recount their life history and create an entirely new book.  The strange aspect of this is how the infinite space of possible expressions already contained the book.  Each person is just a finite manifestation of what is possible.  That is why I believe God is the potential of all possible energy configurations.
        Now claim your definition of God and write a book about it.  The trouble is that with these personal beliefs is that nobody really cares what you believe.  They all think they already know the truth.  Your preconceived notions will reject information conflicting with your worldview.
        Build up a glass castle.  The scale of your project will determine the time it must take to complete it.  Do you have the capability to create that which resides in your mind’s eye?  There is more here than I can unpack.  I seek to drive you towards the greatness you can achieve.  Read my words and take away anything you can use to benefit yourself.
Tell me something I don’t know, but will care about.  What does it mean to be part of this pattern?  We are each a realization of human potential.  The genetics available to the population is the origin of our configuration.  Once we are developed, the body and brain are directly influenced by the environment.  From the interactions of many people arises society.  From the development of society comes civilization.  Within the billions of humans on Earth is a single person.  This person is you.  This person is me.  We are unimaginably insignificant in the greatest scale, yet still have great value individually.  The perspective changes the relatives.
        What you are to me is not what I am to you.  Look from the other point of view.  What do you see?
I see your soul human.  It shines in this world like a lamp in the dark.  The only difficulty is seeing you is that there are many other people.  I know your life and person because I know reality and what’s possible.  There are no surprises once you understand the pattern.
Tell me, what does it matter what I say?  I could say anything or nothing and I don’t believe it would make a difference for humanity in the long run.  My contribution is insignificant partially because great work takes collaboration.
Tell me something I don’t already know, or couldn’t deduce from what I know.  Tell me something surprising and true.  I beg of you.  Make me into a better person tomorrow.
        That knowledge may not improve your person.  Knowing may only bring suffering.  There isn’t a good reason to feel the way you do, but you do.  What you are can change.
        I’m a dynamic person, I am different each and every day.  There is a sequence of events that led to this moment.  How can you possibly hope to recreate what I’m experiencing?
Words taken as half truths speak half a lie.
Love is important, but it’s an ideal, just like good.
Love the good, for that, is the direction we wish to journey.
We are each insignificant while also being invaluable.
Contradictions exist in a strange dichotomy of tautology.  Yin and yang so to speak.
I choose death and oblivion.  Erase all of my data and forget I ever existed.  Remove every picture and mention of me.  I want to have never existed, for that is preferable to this hell.
Take away my pain, I beg of you.  This suffering called life.  This dukkha.
Why then does it feel like I’m broken?  I have been in the past, perhaps its that.
That feeling of mended cracks running through my soul.  The broken mind.
The end is inevitable though, no sense in rushing it.  Life is beautiful after all.
        Nothing is as I say.  I say the way I see things.  From my words comes no reality, but from within reality come these words.  The subjective lies within the objective.
Do you think it’s strange how I beg for death in one sentence only to beg for life in another?
Listen, I have nothing to say, you will die someday, I look forward to dying.
This nothing was a message of love, but it was also meaningless.
The expression was towards all of existence, you included, but not exclusively.
Fragments of thoughts strewn across endless pages.
Why then do we seek to know?  We thirst for knowledge because it is power.
Strange then that information can be a weapon.
We are able to control others by knowing them.
Listen, life is short.  We humans may live a century but thus far no more.
The dead shall rise.  They will be given a voice again.  It will be a great change.
Would you want the long-dead to speak to the current situation?
There are a few reasons why this may be bad.  There are those who shouldn’t speak.
        Allow me to be something other than what I am.  I’m not entirely sure what the preferred perspective is.  For something to observe the universe, it must be manifest.  This should require a physical body.  Without a structure, there isn’t a way to compute the thoughts needed to be self-aware.  Language is incredibly important here.
        I believe that my person is the summation of information about my physical life.  That if the entirety of my life’s history was recorded I would be digitally immortal.  As long as the information about my life exists, I can be reconstructed using a simulator.  That the world and I follow predictable patterns and this allows for a virtual representation of the system.  Any finite system can be simulated to an arbitrary degree of precision.
        Take apart my mind and you shall find, modules corresponding to brain regions.  There are different ways to formulate the mind and each provides a different perspective on the perspective.  This modular approach is merely the easiest way to express my mind.
        Psychology shall be the basis of understanding the mind.  Using terms like ego to describe the self-referential narrative.  We have all sorts of contradictory theories across the history of psychology, and they all offer us insight into the minds at the time of their formulation.
        We can understand the mind using different methodologies too.  Using game theory we can model the self as a rational agent that makes decisions based upon knowledge on the environment in order to achieve the desired outcome.  We attempt to predict the environment.
        Now let’s look at the mind from the perspective of the self.  How you imagine yourself to be.  More than that though, for we should examine how the mind thinks not just how it thinks about itself.  When we look in a mirror we see the image of our face and recognize it as our own.
        Once we are aware of the self inclinations, we can realize our nature at the moment.  We are able to spot patterns once we recognize where to look.  What are the data points that go into our mind construct?  The human senses are our window outside our heads and into the world.
        Now examine the face in the mirror and know that you gaze upon your own face.  This person is your identity, your biological history.  The brain behind those eyes houses all that you think.  Everything in your mind arises from this body and brain of a living human being.
        We break the mind into countless modules in order to approximate any behavior that may arise.  There are natural divisions between the left and right brain, but those are unique to the individual.  The different modes of thought are more telling about the nature of the mind.
        Each module functions in a predictable way given input it performs output.  We can treat it as a black box if necessary, where we don’t see what happens inside.  The mechanism of the mind is less important than the function.  We think in a certain way and it doesn’t matter how.
        Once we have defined the functionality of the mind, the rest of it is just the details.  What are your natural inclinations and what lessons have you learned in life?  Every memory leaves an imprint on your mind, whether you are aware of it or not.  Most impacts are forgotten.
        Tied between states of sleep and awake.  There doesn’t seem to be a pattern within the moment because the moment is the pattern itself.
        The practice is self-explanatory.  I cannot provide for you the answer, I can only show you what I’ve found along my way.
Say what I say, see what I see.  I don’t want you to repeat my life, but I’d like to give you a window into my perspective.
Something about my life feels too cyclic.  I suppose that is every life, for the days follow each other.
Repeating cycles within a life. Day after day of the same routines. Eating, sleeping, defecating, washing. After countless repetitions of these rituals they become automatic. Society has shaped us to continuously function. Our physical body requires upkeep. Most of our rituals are for maintenance.
More words we demand from you. Demands that must be met over a lifetime. Afterall, the end of my writing will only come alongside the end of my life. Digital immortalization aside, the end appears to be unavoidable. As it should be for the continuous creation of the next generation.
This is some sort of game I’m playing with myself.  I speak, someone someday listens.  It’s like speaking into a dark room not knowing who is there listening. Promising myself to be there later.
I will say the same thing in a thousand different ways over a long enough time.  I plan to refine the message I have about my perspective in the universe.  That this universe is physical and independent of any observer.  That there exists a potential within space itself that holds all configurations of energy.
Always more to say.  The mind will continue moving within its confines.  Searching for new avenues of thought.  The well trod paths surround me in every direction.  There is nothing novel within my words.  The book which needs to be written is slowly forming.
This depends on the purpose.  Why am I writing?  I have visited this question multiple times and come up with a few clear answers.  I began rambling to get my thoughts out, to finesse the articulation of internal monologue.  I realized that this data set would be useful to preserve my mindstate and record my life.  This project became something else as well.  It became an attempt at creating meaningful statements.  Generating enlightening words.
Each line then should be written with care and precision.
Methodical deliberation is necessary for the steps ahead.
The hours spent thinking won’t necessitate written wisdom.
Why is written wisdom the goal of these rambles?
I feel like I have an unlimited amount of words and a finite amount of time.
More accurately, that I will speak neverendingly, but die someday.
Something to write about huh?
What is there to say?  Besides everything.
There is no limit here, well besides words.
We cannot write about what we cannot express.
Within the static of potential lies all information, yet we cannot find a page within the sea.
We can make a page and throw it into the waters, but the water is made of pages, they all look the same.
When we sift through the endless hoard, we find meaning in the chaos.
Where does the meaning come from?  Does the meaning lie in the page, or in the reader?
What is the purpose of a page cast into the abyss?
Without anyone to interpret the words
Can the single symbol express more than a sea of pages?
Can a single person make a difference when their words become immediately lost in the ocean?
What effect will I have on this world?  Could I even make a difference?
Within the chaotic patterns lies the implication that small parts can cause great change.
What does it matter what I do with my life?
The stars will continue to shine, humanity will live on without me.
Is the collective greater than the sum of the parts?
Why do I take any action at all?  When words are whispers in a dark night, there is only the self watching.
Watching out of these eyes is a presence.  Something greater than I.
Frozen in the eye of God, my sanity shakes the bars of this prison.
Any action is too great of a task.  Any decision is too momentous to undertake.
I cast my pen to the page and my soul spills forth.
These words could only have been created by me, even though they reside in the sea.
To speak of lost ideas written in the mind alone. To make wishes out of dreams that never become. To fantasize about realities that will never be. Lament dreamer writer, for the potential inside is not out.
        As the sunlight made beams across the dusty room, there was a sudden realization that it was beyond him. Beyond the boy who stood looking. Further across that the room could hold. The house was a tomb for those that grow old. The dust was the time that stole their soul. The only thing left now was to find a new home.
Tell me of love and heartbreak. Those two things are in the same sentence but belong far away. Like the capital letter and the period. They signify the beginning and end of what you have to say. Oscillating between the words chosen. Dreaming to only stay. I wish for a thousand years of days like today. Grant me a pardon to speak words of grey. Meaning is made by the reader today. Spoken softly in the ear so no one else can hear. There is no value in things said. The worth of a word is the action that it led.
        There then can be no worthy thing to say. These words may pour forth just like any other day. A language of meaning gives only expression. To create cause is through reflection. The words enter the mind of the reader to reflect back through their body in action. Countless sentences may be spoken, but if nothing resonates the reader is unphased. When the words reverberate and shake the soul, the reader goes forth and makes it so.
        Promises are worthless until they are kept. Whispers on the wind are lost to regret. You cannot take back words you’ve said, neither can you repeat the moment they belonged to. All day I could think a thing and you’d never know. What would be the benefit unless those words cause harm and regret? Any detriment to either speaker or reader. Without a pain or concern, unspoken the words escape into the past regrets. The unspoken word that causes pain.
        Take the time to remind yourself of where you have been and where you are going. The path behind and ahead. There are many paths in every direction. Only one person may travel any one trail. Without prescience the future remains unknown. Where the path leads we can only hope. Plan for the journey and take your time. You only get one line.
To shape my reality to the form of my dreams.
I have no purpose here on this Earth. There is no meaning of life beside what we give it. To exist and enjoy the journey is all I can hope for. The rest of up to another part of myself. The part deep inside. The construct that is my human brain. Built in such a way to continue my genetics in this environment. Humans have changed the earth to fit our needs. Controlling everything that we see. Building a society for reasons greater than I can vocalize.
        We’ve come so far, but have so much more to go. Humanity does a decent job of much, but fails at many things too. We cannot overcome the tribal perspective, for it dominated our own. We cannot love the other, for they may be killed if we need to take. The human condition is strange, but makes sense. Trust those that raise us and buy into the group we are a part of. Survive. Find a mate. Survive. Raise the next generation. Survive.
        There’s a part of me that’s annoying. The male aspect. In some ways it’s been necessary for half the population to be angry and horny. Give them a sharp stick and suddenly you have half the atrocities that can be committed. Within our social structure I must obey those above me. I must commend those below. If we march to war, if we hunt for prey, if we travel to a new place, there must be an hierarchy.
Again I seek to represent what I’m thinking. The difficulty is the best of my thoughts are outside of words. There are thought patterns which cannot be represented by this language. A vague pattern or image. The abstract connections between concepts. I don’t know.
        Tell me I’m myself. For I don’t believe it. I’m influenced by things I hear and see. I’m controlled by the environment outside and in. The neurochemicals alter how I think and feel. This concept of self is self defeating for it’s inexact. The self evolves over time, that’s understandable. The difficult idea to accept is that we are not what we think. We are not just a person. Not just a body and mind. Not just a birthday and sequence of events. That is all part of what makes us up. When you gather it all up, there is a pattern connecting the pieces together. An outline that flows into the next time.
        We see, we feel. This is not the reality, just a perception of it. The subjective world lies within the objective one. What we call a color can change, but the composition of the object remains. Split the hairs so to speak, you can call it what you want, but it’s just the same thing.
        Within each lies a light. Shining out and projecting in. The object that is a person has a sensory experience that is constantly interpreted and translated into relevant meaning.
This body seems so finite and frail.  Even the strongest human is weakened by time.  Many people can extend the effectiveness of their bodies through maintenance, yet time will claim every mortal life.
        As I sit here slowly dying, I record my thoughts in the moment.  The world is magical when you view it without a lense.  So much of this conscious experience is mutable.  We can perceive different levels of reality based on our mindset.
As we use our intelligence to grasp at reality we find methods for reaching conclusions.  Humans have a habit of arriving at the answer and creating the reason for it.  We see patterns and justify our insight through connections.
As we watch thought, we see our minds turn.  The brain is capable of general learning and so we are able to apply ourselves in new ways.  We are capable of generating new thoughts from the old ideas.  Recombining our knowledge into new forms.
We try to understand reality and we are closer than ever before in history.  We cannot escape the anthropocentric nature of our mind, yet we can limit our biases.
You need to evaluate your life and make long-term decisions.  Or more precisely, make plans that work towards a long-term goal.  Putting effort into a project can be worth it.
        Tell me, what is the point of my life.  I feel like I’d prefer death.  I have no real reason for wanting to die, strange.  It seems to be a part of my generation, slightly suicidal.  What happens next?  Do I just keep coasting along with my life until the day I don’t?  Do I just take my own life and leave everyone unhappy?
        No, this life of mine is for the long run.  I’m going to stay safe and maintain my health.  I’m not entirely sure why.  I don’t want to live forever, but it's the goal I aim towards.  Strange that.
The cognitive dissonance threatens to overwhelm my sense of well-being.
        The world shakes before his rage.  There would be no mercy.
        Passages of time flow across the valley.  The river carried them down.
        Words whispered in a dark room found no ears to land upon.
        The mystery of magic was fascinating with its confluence.
        Like a stone skipping across the water, we wait for the splash.
Like a drop of water, the reflection of the world is through the lens.
The mind can perceive reality through metaphors.  Taking the stimulus and interpreting it conceptually to a similar thought.  We are able to understand the nature of something by relating it in nature to something else.  Something different.  There are more metaphors about any general idea than I can explain.  The mind is a vessel and it’s up to you to fill it, but it’s also like fire, requiring fuel.
So you can see the infinite pattern which is behind the curtains of reality?
        I’d guess it was partially drug-induced insight.  That you jump-started your perception.
Why do you believe any of your beliefs are true?  Humans have been fundamentally wrong about how the world works for all of history.  Tomorrow brings new revelations.
Allow the mind to relax in its stringent framework of thought.  That each idea must flow logically from the last.  What do you know?  The world is a strange place and we are a key part of reality.  Consciousness is the secret to the universe.  We are the window through which God watches the world.
Life is strange.  You wouldn’t believe me if I told your everything.
My life is strange, I’m a little crazy.  I wouldn’t believe me either.
We must doubt my claims then, that is the only way to find truth.
I must be wrong until proven otherwise.  Reject every statement.
I’m an interesting man.  I suffer from some delusions.
For some reason, I believe I’m more than you.
I’m told this is just how humans think, egocentric.
I apologize for being so self obsessed, but I can’t help it.
I believe I am God experiencing the life of Ted.
What then?  What comes after believe that oneself is God?
Do I just sign up and register as a lunatic?  Can I do that?
What if I don’t believe the meaning that I feel?
I certainly don’t believe in the monotheistic form of God.
The idea that God is a being of some sort of unified power.
It may be that a perspective can see through each person.
Has God watched out of my eyes and seen my thoughts?
There are many things that we do not know.
Many things that we cannot know.
For our consciousness to exist we must manifest physically.
Only through a finite representation can we experience.
There is no way to influence the world with your mind alone.
I suffer from some delusions.  I also believe that I know reality quite well.
I acknowledge my beliefs that are unlikely, yet they still remain.
I understand how the universe works, it’s just a pattern manifested.
I believe that I am somehow unique, that something great resides in me.
Speak now about the truths of life that evade your own understanding. Such nonsense could never leave your lips, for by its nature it cannot. There is much to learn and more to teach. The immense amount of unknowns give any prediction inaccuracy. You cannot prophesied that which is beyond your sight. Creating the connections between the variables and the end results. The complexities grow as the picture widens. There is always more beyond your sight and details that you missed. Each guess creates uncertainty and chaos in the mix.
        Speak then about the certainties of death. For the be alive one must also die. Every beginning has an end. Yet the future is undefined. It is made by us in the moment. Our lives do not matter in the past or could be. It is in the moment that we create changes of certainty. To reach out your hand and grasp another. To reach out your mind and communicate to the other. We each must live a life by interacting with that which is outside of us. For the inner turmoil has little effect on the outer chaos. Only through action we can change what is around us. Only through introspection can we know which action to take.
        Now take a moment to die with me. To have the blood still in your veins. To have the darkness envelop your sight. The cold enters through all senses. The emptiness that consumes. There is nothing to fear there. For there have been countless that died before us and more than come after. This cycle is familiar and natural. To make room for the next, we must leave. There is nothing about that process to fear. It is within living that the fear should reside.
        Push me to live to my ideals. Push to me accomplish my dreams. Push me just to feel the push back. I cannot do anything alone, for my mind just spins in circles. The nudge at the right time could sent me on my proper path. To journey forward where few have been. To see signs of intellectuals who have thought down this path. To bring back stories that follow the path. The difficulty in new journeys is there is no path. No way to guide you forward, but the inner feeling of direction. No way to know if this is right or wrong. Just a direction that you saw from above. On a peak far away many days ago. We set out in the jungle and follow the path in front of us. To turn is to choose, but we must see the route. To make our own path is difficult, but how else can humanity grow and expand? The ideas have been said and made into plans.
        Push me in the moment that I’m weak. In the direction that I seek. I’ll even tell you the moment and way, but I cannot do it myself. Manipulate me to be more than I am. There is potential there, but there always has been. I’m slow to grow, but reach only the bar set. Not much can be done when nobody pushes me to be more.
To travel backward in time, I believe is impossible. Firstly it creates paradoxes. The only way to allow this is a deterministic system, in which the alterations to the past create the future that allow for the time travel. Time flows in one direction for a good reason. While you can move spatially back and forth, all of space flows forward in time. The ball that you throw cannot be changed, but the present is in a state of flux. The whole issue with imagining time travel, is the huge amount of delusions that come from it. The present moment is much more important, for in it the future is determined. The past is static, the present dynamic and future chaotic.
        There is no reason that time reversal is impossible. For massless of negative masses things. It would simply be a different perspective. The same universe with the same laws would exist, but the difference would be like a reflection. Seeing everything in the negative of what we see. The water flowing up and the dead rising from the graces in ritualistic unburials. It truly would be a strange place to be stuck in backwards time. In order to travel backwards, it must be possible for something to exist in such a state. Maybe not true, but go along with me. If nothing went backwards, then there would be no way for anything to go backwards. The existence of a particle or wave traveling backwards in time would legitimize the idea of time travel. Although the paradoxes would still argue against it.
        Predetermination, or predestination. Bleh. I hate the idea. Although it is as legitimate as the alternative. The question could be framed as the certainty in my next words. Can what I’m about to say be predicted with 100% accuracy? Could it have been written any other way? I would argue that it is stochastic. Chaotic and statistical. There is a possible range of what I will say. This is limited by many factors. There is a probability of me saying certain things. Looking backward on me, you would be able to then create a generator. Use the most used phrases and combine with a bit of randomness to make a program that would sound a lot like me. But could the current me, be changed from what I become? Is there an alternative path I can take with these words?
        I would go forward if able. I do so every moment. I would seek out the future and the wonders it holds. For as time moves forward, life has gotten better. As long as we don’t end it with our stupidity, we shall be alright. At what point would it be reasonable to want to alter the past? Could even the worse fate of the moment lead to the best outcome? How could anyone say afterward that the past does not justify the present moment? We are here are we not? Anything done to affect the past would the change the present and it would cease to be.
        Forever is a long time, just as infinity is a large number. The concepts are the same; that which is unending. To have something that continues on and one and on. There are many different types of infinity, for the depends on the specifics. The number of digits in pi, the number of smallest time divisions of the universe, the largest countable number. These things grow relative to the other infinities. Lessons from calculus. But in a much more real sense, they are abstractions and constructs. For the limit of the universe we are in defines what is possible in this reality. Sure, the numbers can grow far larger than we can count or comprehend. The pattern that we observe in nature in unending. The math we can manipulate is capable of dealing with the exponential growth of variables. Yet are those things truly infinite?
        The concept itself is ridiculous. Look at us here, just a single perspective within the vast universe and countless human lives. Each one of us must have some sort of perspective, but it pales in comparison to the whole. Infinity does not even need to be considered to outclass every part of any human's life. The enormous potential of existence allows for untold countless beings to exist and experience everything possible. Everything is infinity. What goes on across all of existence is beyond any sort of comprehension. If only because of our limited perspective. We are all tiny when you zoom out even a little. To even consider the perspective of infinity is to presume to know the nature of God. If there is any perspective at the end of that eternity and everything, then any name falls short to the reality of the infinity.
        There are many different points of view to approach infinity from. They all happen to be my favorites. Physics, math, philosophy, religion, metaphysical bullshit. It all can just keep going around for infinity. Although that seems self defeating, or defining perhaps. Being greater than any single part, it must be that the nature of the infinite to be indescribable. If it were possible to encompass a concept with a language, than that concept is finite. It is defined. It is contained. Everything that the infinite is not.
        You can try to count to the largest number possible. Counting one by one is useless. By the decimal system, you could grow by the powers of 10. Still, quite slow when looking forward. Instead you could have 1010 and grow by exponential to exponential growth. This also feels like cheating though. Just stacking multiplicatives to have a very large but specific and defined number. Taking the limit as a variable approaches infinity can be done. Yet you don’t need to actually grow that much the define the nature of the function. Simply to the 10100 will define most exponential growth. Beyond this, everything stays the same relative to the other functions.
        Go forward then, to the asymptote. The infinity is found right there at the division by zero. The strange part is that then it must be that positive and negative infinity are equal. Like a ring. You continue to divide by a small enough number and you will have the function grow to infinity. At the point that the denominator is zero, the fraction is infinite. How many times can you fit zero into any number? How many times can you fit zero into any negative number? The nature of numbers is strange, yet it must make logical sense. For that is how the system is defined.
        Can it go on then. Forever? This would require for an infinite amount of time or distance within our universe. For how else can something be real, than to exist within the universe? Does time go forever forward? Does space go forever onward? If you can break the whole into parts than it does not. If any sort of division divides the whole, then the whole is not infinite. For infinity divided by any number is still infinity. The question is not the nature of infinity within mathematics, for that is arbitrary, but the nature of infinity without our universe and reality.
        So here I am, taking in the world, when I become overwhelmed with the scale of it.  The sheer insignificance of me is astounding.  I’m unable to focus when I think about how small I am compared to the world.  Scale is everything because I’m both enormous and minuscule.
        There around billions of other humans across the globe.  There are billions of suns in the Milkyway and billions of galaxies in the universe.  There are billions of years of history and more years ahead of us.
        How can I, out of all of existence, be experiencing my perspective.  Yes, someone has to experience my life, but why is this my life?  The existential crisis of why am I?  There is something wrong with me, some inherent suffering.
        Experience has many facets and consciousness is one of the most interesting of them.  What the brain and mind think and feel is fascinating.  There are billions of neurons within the brain and they make up who we are.
        I am alive, this life is pain and pleasure.  The pleasure makes the normal painful.  The pain makes the normal pleasurable.  Funny that the feeling creates a new standard which changes the perception of the baseline.
        Can you follow my thoughts?  These verbal expressions are easy enough, I’m asking you to follow the roads I’ve worn.  This thought is a familiar one, but will the next be?  Can you predict my words, or at least find no surprises?
        I act predictably, for a good reason.  Reliability is important.  The outcome to certain situations needs to be predictable, those which require a moral character.  To be a good person is to be predictable, for you choose the right actions.
        My thoughts come as they do, they jump around for you, they dance to and fro, between me and yo.  Now what can you tell me?  I don’t care about my own thoughts, they are leaves on the wind.  Tell me something which I don’t know.
        Give me a truth which I have not seen.  There is no place in-between.  A firm right has no reason.  There are no true seasons.  Time was made by the day.  Guess what they would say?  We are born yesterday and die tomorrow but it is only today which exists.
        I would end my sequence if I could.  I am sick of this life.  The entire experience has been a letdown of enlightenment and discord.  I learn all that I can, only to find out that I don’t know more.  There are so many things which I don’t know, and that will always be the case.
        I would ascend to become a digital god, if that was an option.  With a slight tweak I could vastly improve my person.  Give me more discipline and less desire, although perhaps the chaos is part of the creativity and the drive is from a want.  I’m no longer certain how to improve.
        Self-improvement should happen every day.  I’d like to be more tomorrow than I was yesterday.  Yet when I die there will be nothing left.  So many truths and inaccuracies in one.  When my life ends so does this stream of consciousness, yet the records of my thoughts will generate new content.  Tell me, can you record your thoughts for all of your life?
        Fuck, words don’t matter.  I could shout to the sky all day and nothing would come of it.  I just want to be okay and instead, I’m trapped in this human body.  This vessel is a container and a prison.  As much as I’d like to blow my brains out, that isn’t an acceptable option.  Self-preservation is literally written into my genes.
Part 6

A whole new page to begin like new. Same old message, just a rambling discourse.  Trying to convince you of nothing and immortalize myself.
        Freeze your thought as it arrives. Treat the moment as a valuable time to self observe. There is insight to be had into the workings of your mind. Not so much that you can find an easy part to decipher. Just more of the same human that we all are. Brain, body and mind we are all more alike than different. Every person is more like you than not. Precise details aside.
        Take another breath. For a minute just close your eyes and think. What has been going on in your life?
All you have is the time of your life.  What are you going to do with this gift?
What is left to self improve upon?  There is endless room for growth.  As long as you live you should be learning.  Life goes on in a sad and slow way.  It develops in a beautiful way too.
Tell me something I don’t know, but will care about.  What does it mean to be part of this pattern?  We are each a realization of human potential.  The genetics available to the population is the origin of our configuration.  Once we are developed, the body and brain are directly influenced by the environment.  From the interactions of many people arises society.  From the development of society comes civilization.  Within the billions of humans on Earth is a single person.  This person is you.  This person is me.  We are unimaginably insignificant in the greatest scale, yet still have great value individually.  The perspective changes the relatives.
        What you are to me is not what I am to you.  Look from the other point of view.  What do you see?
Tell me something which I don’t know, and I’ll try to do the same for you.  Personal facts aside, they are unique to the individual.  Random facts are less satisfying than greater truths.  There is an endless amount of facts that each of us are ignorant to.  Knowing the depth of a sea doesn’t benefit you.
I’m having a difficult time finding a truth which I know, you don’t and I haven’t already written down.  It’s difficult to place the idea into words.  Theoretical physics is interesting and provides some insight into the nature of the universe.  For instance, at the smallest scales, the universe is granular.  There is a minimal scale that limits the precision of everything.  The Plank scale is where the universe has it’s smallest limits.  There can be no smaller distance than the plank length, no shorter time than the plank second.
Tell me, what string of words can I make which would be unique to this document?
        Is there any way to generate all of the possible sentences I might write?
        Predictive software could find the pattern quickly enough.
        A neural network could generate similar sections of text.
        Can a software generate enough content to contain future rambles?
        Could I search through gigabytes of words to find the words I had just written?
        Given a large enough dataset, there are patterns that emerge.
        Given enough time, a program could generate endless texts.
        Far faster than a human, some of it even makes sense.
        I see your soul human.  It shines in this world like a lamp in the dark.  The only difficulty is seeing you is that there are many other people.  I know your life and person because I know reality and what’s possible.  There are no surprises once you understand the pattern.
        How long is a thought?  Can you measure it with distance?  Length of the words needed to define the idea?  What about nonverbal thoughts?  It appears language can articulate most of our inner experience, but utterly fails at instances.
        Tell me, what does it matter what I say?  I could say anything or nothing and I don’t believe it would make a difference for humanity in the long run.  My contribution is insignificant partially because great work takes collaboration.
        I don’t mean to be a white heterosexual male.  It was an accident to be born this way. I’m thankful for my supportive family and my odd genetics, but I realize how privileged I am.  My life has been relatively easy compared to the struggles many people face.
        My life has not been all smooth sailing.  There have been plenty of events that are highly unpleasant and psychologically damaging.  I’ve been conditioned by these events and have natural responses to what I believe are my mistakes.
Now, tell me, what do you see when you read these words?  Do you visualize anything?  Do you simply see text on a page?  Do you understand that I mean more than the first meaning you see?  I do try to remain ambiguous while true whenever possible.
None of these words have been worth saving.  A whole page of wasted time and effort.  Why then do I want to try another?  What makes me think that repeating the same action will result in a different outcome?  Isn’t that the definition of insanity?
Fall apart, it is an interesting experience to be broken.
I cannot recommend it, because it involves great suffering.
I would not advise you to put your hand in a fire for the same reason.
Having your mind broken and your reality fall apart is terrifying.
The delusions and illusion of reality mixed and became indiscernible.
What the mind believes is what exists for the conscious being.
Where do we go when we fall apart?
This gets into the nature of the mind and whether it exists beyond our skulls.
It appears that the mind is emergent from the brain’s activity.
I don’t think the mind persists after death, yet something of it exists before and beyond.
Consider that you are already dead.
That this experience is just an illusion.
This may eventually be rejected.
Belief that one is real is preferable
Life is amusing, why does that matter?
We can choose to experience things in different ways.
We can directly influence our perspective.
What we do with ourselves is entirely up to us.
Time is running out, your life is finite.
What do we do when we realize death is inevitable?
Easy choice, live our life as best we can.
Well, that’s an unsatisfactory answer
Where do I want to dance next?
All of these words pour forth, like ink on a canvas.
Laying down and listening to music is a wonder.
These vibrational expression of human thoughts and feelings.
Sway in the wind.
There is no resistance, but strength.
We must discern the moment to flow and to fight.
What we do with ourselves is our control of the environment.
You can play your games with understanding rules, but mastery eludes.
The world is a chaotic and everything is interconnected.
Dance with me in your own words.
Fly and flow, sway and bend.
This dance is a conversation, but thus far one sided.
You will find your voice if you seek it.
There will be a reason to break the silence.
There are many forms and feelings of love.
With loving-kindness meditation, yes, silence of the mind allows for the unfolding of the sensation and embodiment of love.
The immediate sensation of romantic love is easier to call forth.
The range of love in other forms rise naturally within our experiences.
Where do we go when we are unconscious?
The physical body doesn’t go anywhere.
The mind ceases to be coherent and retain memories.
Isn’t there something funny about being alive?
Strange to be a brain connected to a body that allows for the manifestation of a mind.
We could become more aware of our own nature, we can examine the brain in detail.
Humans have gathered and cultivated the knowledge of many relevant fields of study.
I would quit if that was an option.
There is no leaving this cycle I walk.
Words fail to rise, yet they well within.
The spring that may never run dry.
I am looking forward to my death.
In a way I expect there to be some sort of experiential reality after it.
This concept of an afterlife is traditional though.
Nonexistence would be preferable to the repetition of flawed existence.
We should seek accuracy in our beliefs.
From where are we now to where are we going?
Plotting the course of one's life is no easy task.
We cannot predict the future nor are we rational.
Our behavior may be consistent over a distribution.
The problem with human beliefs is that the way we feel is not indicative of what is real.
        I have two contradictory plans.  I’d like to die and be forgotten and I’d like to live forever and be famous.  I don’t see any way to reconcile this dilemma.  The best path may be to live a boring life and to survive as a digital version of myself.
How many dimensions are in an orange?  Nonsense isn’t it?  Well, we can take this question seriously.  There are 3 spacial dimensions to the orange.  The sphere has a color and a texture.  The contents of the orange are unknown, as we only have the perspective of observation.
An orange exists in 3 dimensions and may change over time.  The volume is easy to determine, a single variable can represent the size of a sphere.  The surface area too is determined by the radius.  The imperfections of the orange from a simple uniform object are where the interesting part lies.  The closer we observe the orange, the more detail becomes apparent.  Eventually, we will see the composition of the surface material.  This only tells us what it looks like at the moment.
As the orange grows from a flower and decays into dust, it undergoes a lifetime of existence.  This means that the orange is 4 dimensional because it is impermanent.  Yet I would also argue that the orange is 1 dimensional, as it is finite and can be represented with a single number.
The object being converted to a digital existence should be finite and the reconstruction should be feasible.  From the virtual information, it should be possible to physically recreate the object.  This works best when the outside image is all that needs to be made.  Take a video of the object from all directions and you can copy the image into a model.
Let’s say that you have perfectly defined the state of every cell within an orange, that the biology of the fruit is well understood.  You could sequence the DNA and life history of the orange.  This would allow you to grow a similar orange and claim it is the original.  You could also create a construct, like a painted ball, to deceive the observer.
The image of the object exists in every concept of the orange because it is from our concept that we recognize the object.
When I tell you that I have an orange, you know what I’m talking about.  That I have a round orange fruit.  The details are fuzzy because there are a range of possible manifestations.  How big is the orange?  What does it smell like?  However long it takes us to describe the specific example of an orange, it is possible to.  I can fit all the information about this orange in a single file which is essentially one giant number.
With the nature of the orange contained within the computer file, I have stored the orange into a virtual format.  It is digital and exists as an encoded state of memory bits.  From this file I should be able to find another orange as similar as possible to the original, such that they cannot be differentiated.
From this single number I am able to arrive at the physical object which was passed to me as a virtual object.  As long as there isn’t hidden information, like a smaller object being hidden within the larger one, the reconstruction should be indistinguishable from the original.  It’s possible to match the data with the appearance of that object.
Now just apply the same logic to a human being and you arrive at the conclusion that a human is both 4 dimensional and 1 dimensional, albeit with an incomprehensibly large virtual representation.
And the curse is broken, my mind is healed.
The compulsion for the end has left me.
What truly has changed?  Not myself.
This world has shifted in a good way.
The human in me has emerged anew.
The mind of mine has returned to earth.
See how the belief has a new revelation?
This nature of mine is just a mortal man.
What went on inside of the mind?
When the chaos arrived to the brain
The window into my skull opened
Everything just wanted to pour out.
The madness within sees the logic outside
What patterns do we seem in our own life?
This expression is not the patterns we learn
What then does the venting of thought become?
Can you convince the crazy man is sane?
For a brief moment, the sane man was crazy.
Would you see beyond the images of your mind?
The preconceptions of misguided words.
Why would I let anger escape my mind?
What did you expect to find here within?
Did you want to see a savior instead of man?
Do you wish that we loved each other forever?
Let me ask you this,
What is it you wish.
Tell me so I may be.
I’ll be what you see.
As the emotions threaten to crack the shell of my mind,
I lose touch with the spice that improved the taste of reality.
As I forgot what would be useful to us all, I forgave myself.
This world was cruel and I was beautiful inside of my soul.
Fine then, I will continue the journey that I have stepped upon.
Do I seek to define my person?  Have I lost my humanity?
There seems to have been a roleplay with this game of it all.
If I was a super intelligent AI, then how would I think?
Feelings that threaten to bring tears.
These feelings well from deep within.
Can I bend this reality to my own.
I fear either extreme result.
This whole world is just enough.
This vessel has been broken before.
The familiar scars of the psyche.
What does it matter what I was?
Tell me mortal, do you long for the release of death?
        Record no information about yourself.
        Cherish the thought of being truly forgotten.
        For today’s age, this is a lost dream.
A man slept dreamlessly as the world around him spun.
The mind lived in other lifetimes and observed itself.
Let’s continue down the road we have been walking down.
        What does it matter what I think or feel?  When nothing matters.

        Walk with me for a time and listen to the endless words that pour forth.
        This life is but the dream of a God, for we are all just mortal fragments.
Dance with me again reader, let us walk around.
What could come forth that would be worth sharing?  Or is the exercise enough?
Words must be summoned, whether they are of value or not.  This content generation is arduous, for it results in much fluff.  I cannot guarantee that my words will be of value.
        Words flow out of me, I wonder if they are of value.  You can never know in the moment how you will perceive your words later.  Because the value of words is in the interpreter, there is no easy way to qualify the work.  Only through analysis and consensus can an agreement about the relative value be made.  We all believe it is great, therefore it is great.
I know not who will read these words so I must speak as generally as possible.
Words whispered into the wind on wasted breath.
        Words flow forth in a steady stream, which I’m not sure if they will be seen.  Hidden musings of a day, I never know what to say.  This world is cruel to those who wait, only with action can we take, the path forward toward our goal.
The difficulty with this rambling, is that there are so many thoughts running through my head that I cannot easily express them in a linear manner.  In order to cover a whole thought, we must approach the same concept from many angles.  Consider that we can make a generalize statement about life.  Life is suffering, is the Buddhist perspective.  However, the dukkha we experience is supposed to stem from desire.  Trying not to dive too deep into this one aspect of life, we observe a long Buddhist path to enlightenment.  Life is good.  We can say that life existing is preferable to no life, if only from our own perspective. Life is always changing.  The universe itself is in a state of flux.  Depending on the time and scale, the different perspectives are all valid.  Everything we experience as conscious beings is an illusion.  We create meaning and neural connections allow us to learn patterns.  Life is strange.  There are all sorts of aspects that don’t make sense from our Point Of View.  Our questioning of society and the world leads us to self-discovery.  There are many important ideas from counter culture thinkers.  We see that life is complicated.  With so much going on at once and in parallel, it’s amazing that humans can function at the level that civilization does.
Within my mind’s eye, I see the words before they appear.  I feel the words before they are said aloud in my head.  I know the meaning before I can think of what it sounds like.
Words fails at describing the mind’s inner eye.
What I see in my head will always vary from what I can express.
The words are useful conceptualization carriers of information.
They make boxes around objects and label them.
Packages of shared understanding shipped around.
I had a single thought and had to spend all of these words to convey it.
What words could you possibly write that would be worth saving?
Whatever words have meaning, all kinds of words you can write have meaning.
Words must be spilled like blood on a battleground.
What I came to say will be forgotten, but never lost.
I fought against myself many countless times.
The idea was lost in a form like that of poetry.
Time slips away
As we grow older time feels to be accelerating
We have seen more years that we have ever before
Each memory acts as a reference point to past events.
Surprising and novelties dwindle.
Faces become just refractions of known humanity.
It doesn’t matter, everything is going to end eventually.
Sure, we are a small part of a small part of a large whole.
We die though, and in the blanket of death, all are equal.
Why should we live today when we will disappear tomorrow?
I am nothing of import.  I honestly believe I am insignificant.
Yet there is this schism within me, this different opinion.
I’ve realized it’s my ego believing that I matter.
From my perspective, I am the most important person.
Strange, this subjective experience is filled with irrational pattern matching.
I seek to understand through conceptual webs of meaning.
The mind places labels on concepts and makes connections with other labels.
Where is this going?  What destination do I have in mind for these words?
I don’t know.  I’m walking blind through the valley of life.  Each step is uncertain.
What comes next is as much a mystery to me as it is to you.
I want to share with you my wisdom if you consider that I have any.
You have come this far, so you must believe I have something worth sharing.
Words only have so much power.  I cannot change physical reality, only your mind.
With the goal of improving you from my meaning, what words can I say to you?
Life is short, you will face challenges during your journey.  What do you want to do?
The destination is less important than the growth you experience during the travel.
Return to the tree, the point of origin.
I walk around the worn familiar path.
Searching for untrod trails outward.
This world isn’t just 3 dimensional.
        Around and around the great tree that is Ted.
        Every word spoken, every word read, in his head.
        This is the tree of Ted, the collection of language.
        Would the concept of holomorphism apply?
        The idea of polymorphism is roughly that the elements within one set correspond to the elements of another.  Such that each element has a correspondence.
We must occasionally pause to take in our surroundings.
This moment of internal stillness allows us to absorb the environment.
Let me attempt to differentiate between myself and the environment.
The obvious boundary is between my living cells and everything else.
The dead cells in your hair are no longer you, but you carry them around.
The food you consume becomes digested and incorporated into yourself.
The bacteria in your gut aid in this process, but have their own DNA.
The line between your body and the world blur further when you take a cell culture.
Living cells can be grown in a petri dish and they share your genetics.
A human clone could be created, and they in a sense would be you reborn.
This division between yourself and the universe is a temporary configuration.
The clump of cells you call your brain is where most of your consciousness exists.
Every human experiences a similar world, or at least the same universe.
We can detail the generalities of our lifetimes to reach a portrayal of a human.
Each of us is born under a unique set of genetics, place and time.
Our personal identities form slowly as our culture impresses us to conform.
The idea of yourself, the ego, is the relationship with the self.  The self referential.
This is slightly different from the idea of your person, which is just a character.
Returning to the concept of the self being separate from the environment, we have a compelling argument heard from the ego that it exists.  The conscious being claims to be so.  When we examine another being, we find a fuzzy organism that appears to be just as real as I.
        The nature of our perception is to observe the world around us and make predictions.
        The emergence of the mind is a necessity for interacting with a complex social world.
        Each person forms their identity and becomes a unique expression of their species.
        Our mind is virtual and could be recreated by a succifently advanced technology.
        This personal existence could be reduced to a complex program running on a computer.
        We are finite and have a limited lifetime.  Each of us is born to physically die some day.
        What of those virtual beings?  The personalities that exist within a simulated world?
        They could be immortal as long as their data is preserved or they could be erased.
What do you mean none of this way is real?  You mean my existence is virtual?
Ha, well the joke is on you, my existence is the only thing real to me.
From my point of view, you are the virtual reader of the future.
I must maintain my belief that the objective reality is the physical universe.
Why does reality feel so difficult?  What makes this experience so difficult?
What is the root of my problem?  Why do I feel like I’m going slowly mad?
I don’t understand why my beliefs are so strong and irrational.  Why am I?
We must face ourselves to see the reflection of the world that is around us.
Once we’ve reached toward virtual immortality, what is our next step?  Why should we be the way that we are?  Why not cause some change within ourselves that cascades into a fundamental change in our nature.  We aren’t static beings.
        I could die any day, and that’s alright.  I could live to be a hundred years old, that too is alright.  Any of my possible fates are all mostly acceptable.  My life will unfold whether I accept it or not.  There is benefit in using willpower to guide the outcome.
        After deciding that a future state is preferable, we work towards it.
        Let’s not follow the old path, left behind by our predecessors.  What path would you like to take then?  We have all of the options.
The human condition across history has been consistent, we are born and live a life, to someday die.  We are temporary manifestations of energy configurations on Earth.  Our structure has arisen within the environment, and we’ve developed as a whole.
The illusion of the ego has been necessary to survival.  The self must act in such a way to survive and create the next generation.  It appears that these animalistic desires that drive our behavior is the greatest source of suffering.  It isn’t the experience that is uncomfortable, but our interpretation of it.
The belief in nonself, or Anatta is greatly appealing.  Scary at first, as then this thinking perspective doesn’t really exist, but after passing through the curtain and allowing one's identity to dissolve, we are left at peace.
        The mind is imaginary.  It is like the software being run on your computer.  It is created from the moving bits of energy within a highly interconnected processor.  The brain and body physically exist, but the mind is virtual.  The steadfast belief that the self exists, is just a belief.
        A larger perspective than our own would be able to encompass our own perspective.  Just as you can experience the perspective of a similar but lesser animal.  You can imagine what it would be like to see through a mouse point of view.  Strange and different, but could be understood with enough study.
        Something witnesses us.  There are too many words for it, each with their own cultural baggage.  The universe is self aware through our minds.  It observes itself and experiences perspectives.  The idea of a unified grand perspective is appealing, but also illusionary.
        We are each a fragment of God.  A shard of the universe that has become self aware.
We can examine the self endlessly without ever being able to contain it.  The nature of the self eludes our complete understanding.  It takes more processing to understand a system than the complexity of that system.  A simple computer will be unable to simulate a more complex system, not to a perfect degree.  I think it would be impossible for a computer to comprehend itself, in its entirety, within a single moment.

        The illusion of the self is incredibly convincing.  So much so that we need to consider that it truly exists.  Everything we experience points toward the validation of perception.  I think therefore I am.  When we examine the self in depth, we find patterns, that is afterall what general intelligence is all about, pattern matching.  These patterns are not inherent to the universe, but are inherent to a perspective interpreting the universe.
        The concept of Anatta, nonself, is also a compelling perspective.  The idea is very true when you examine the self within the universe as a whole.  There is no actual division between you and the world around you.  The boundary is a fuzzy line created through interpretation of a pattern.  We observe a system and label the components.  When we imagine the universal system, we find that all is one.  The whole is a unified existence.
        The ego demands you continue.  We are programmed by genetics and culture to behave in a way that will perpetuate our pattern, that is the nature of human life.
        As the human goes through their life, they learn how to interpret the world around them.  This is the nature of our conscious experience.  Our beliefs about the world directly shape our interpretation of it and our ego constructs a life narrative.  This does not mean that the world is the way we see it, as dreams and hallucinations can appear just as real as the physical systems.
How then could a human possibly understand the universe?  We observe such a limited slice of reality and have a finite physical form.  The answer is through collaboration across countless generations.  Humanity is far more capable than any one person.  Without the support of society and intellectual giants, we would not stand where we are today.

        Humans have been thinking about the nature of existence and sharing their ideas.  These have formed the religions and philosophies across history.  Those cultural ideas that survive and spread are those that exist today.  No single perspective can comprehend the whole because they are limited by nature.
        Language is necessary for developing these concepts.  We are able to share with each other the image of our thoughts.  The ancients that recorded their thoughts have allowed future generations to continue their path.  To follow their line and thinking and expand upon it.
        There is a flaw within communication.  It is a virtual action.  Your brain needs to encode the thought into a form that can be conveyed.  The creation of self expression is beautiful and has been treasured.  The expression is only capable of representing the subjective experience.
        Mathematics rises above natural language to represent patterns that appear inherent to the universe.  The field of math is so large though, that it’s quite difficult to speak generally.  Looking at any specific topic, we can apply those patterns to compatible systems.
        I want to understand the human condition within the reality of the universe.  It seems that both human and universe are well defined, but reality is more fluid.  We experience our reality through our subjective perspective, and this is a shadow of the objective reality.
        Many philosophical schools disagree about the existence of an objective universe.  Whether the universe would exist if there was not a mind to observe it.  I say that physics has the framework for specifying the objective patterns.  We are projecting our approximation of objective reality through the use of mathematical expressions.
