**LLM Base Repository**
=====================

Welcome to the LLM Base repository, where we develop and train large language models to push the boundaries of natural language processing and understanding.

**About**
--------

This repository contains the implementation and training code for our large language model, including model architectures, training scripts, and evaluation metrics. The model is designed to learn from large amounts of text data and generate human-like language outputs.

**Getting Started**
--------------------

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.10
* PyTorch 1.9+ (see local readme for some restrictions)
* NVIDIA GPU (recommended)
* conda

### Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com//llm.git`
2. Change director to a project cd base/gpt2
2. Follow Local Readme for a given project example


**Directory Structure**
---------------------

* `base/`: Base LLM modes from scratch
* `data/`: Datasets and data preprocessing scripts, limited bring your own data
* `notebooks/`: Training, evaluation, and inference scripts
